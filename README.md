# oversizeALims

This is a two-part submission.

To reproduce both manuscripts, clone this repository and run `setup.sh`
at the command line. Note that this file is **NOT** an executable, so
you will need to call the relevant shell command, for example
`bash ./setup.sh` This will install the R packages required to compile
everything else.

You will also need to install GNU Make, if your machine does not already
have it. You can check this in a terminal by calling `which make`. If
nothing happens, you can install this using `apt install make` for
Unix/Mac, or if using Windows, via `choco install make` or manually from
the [GNU website](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

Finally, run the `Makefile` by calling `make` in a Unix shell. This
simple command will analyze the data, produce the figures and tables,
and render the manuscripts.
