This directory has data I collected while characterizing some potential
materials for another experiment.

I am using the psa data to derive the D50 for the silt I used in the oversize Atterberg limits experiment....this was the finer of the sil-co-sil products.

The data files here therefore contain some extra data, which was not part of 
the oversize Atteberg limits experiment, but it can be easily filtered out.
