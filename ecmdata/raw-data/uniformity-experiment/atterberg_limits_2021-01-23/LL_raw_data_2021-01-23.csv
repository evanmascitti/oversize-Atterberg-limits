LL,2021-01-23,Quickcrete_Cu_Casselman,mix_28,7,25,30,16.687,15.422,2020-05-24,"This is one of the most frustrating samples I have ever tested. It took over an hour to nudge the water content up, 6-8 drops at a time, to the point where it will flow properly. It seems that the mixes near the transitional fines content tend to be this way. I think it might be especially true for this one - though it feels relatively weak when stirring in the bowl, once you put it in the cup and jar it several times I think the percussion actually jars the particles into a more dense configuration. That would make sense for this once since the sand was deliberately chosen to be non-uniform. Also, the mixes near the TFC tend to not pack too well - I think you get a lot of air pockets inside them, leading to premature failure which can fool you as the operator. Then when you add enough water to actually weaken the clay enough that the air is easily squeezed out, you find that the blow count actually goes up. The clay still has enough toughness to prevent flow between 15-35 blows. Highly frustrating."
