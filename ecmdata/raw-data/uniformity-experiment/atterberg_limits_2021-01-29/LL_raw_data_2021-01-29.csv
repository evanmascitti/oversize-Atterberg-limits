LL,2021-01-29,Quickcrete_Cu_Casselman,mix_38,5,44,35,13.998,13.208,2020-05-24,"this one was really hard to test. The groove was difficult to cut and it clearly influences the number of blows - if you use the curved tool it could be lower than 15 and with the standard tool it was over 30, for the same water content. I always make the final pass with the standard groooving tool to ensure the width of the groove is correct....sometimes it ends up being a bit too wide with the sandy soils, but I think this appears worse than it actually is because as the large grains are torn from the groove walls they leave gaping holes and jagged edges. When the soil begins to flow downward these close relatively easily. Also, for these soils the LL is relatively low, and all four data points tend to lie within <0.5 % water content or so. Therefore although there is some uncertainty associated with the blow count, because there are so many data points clustered within a small range you can still feel pretty confident about predicting the blow count for 25 blows compared to another mix."
