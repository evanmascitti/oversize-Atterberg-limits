<!-- At present, infield soil specifications have focused on particle size analysis (PSA). -->
<!-- Unfortunately, the results of a PSA do not always characterize soil behavior as a function of water content.  -->
<!-- The Atterberg limits offer an attractive means of assessing infield mixes because they are directly linked to changes in water content. -->


<!-- Wet-sieving may be inevitable for samples having appreciable amounts of gravel which would interfere with the tests. -->
<!-- Large gravel particles would clearly preclude the use of the percussion cup and hand-rolling tests, but the effect of sand particles 425-2000 &mu;m is not clear. -->


<!-- Some engineered soils are diligently screened to ~ 2 mm. -->
<!-- It is possible that the LL and PL tests could be run on these samples, but no information is available on how the result would compare to the pure fines (i.e. with the "oversize" particles removed). -->



<!-- The present study was motivated by two factors: -->

<!-- 1. the additional time and labor required to complete the tests when particles > 425 &mu;m are removed. -->

<!-- 1. the difficulty in comparing infield mixes with identical % sand when unequal portions of their sand fractions are removed.   -->

<!-- A more niche application of soil plasticity is found in soils used for baseball and softball infields.  -->
<!-- The plasticity of the soil is important for stable footing and predictable ball response.  -->
<!-- Field managers diligently adjust soil water content by hand-watering and deployment of impervious covers.  -->
<!-- The Atterberg limits offer an attractive means of assessing infield mixes because they are directly linked to changes in water content. -->
<!-- Infield soils are commonly screened to < 2 mm, but they may also contain significant quantities of sand 0.425 - 2 mm.  -->
<!-- This poses a challenge to the use of Atterberg limit tests on infield mixes.  -->
