title: "Comments and suggestions for Atterberg limits paper"
---

- ~~find reference for why other thresholds were discarded (it's in Casagrande 1932)~~


- ~~figure out what we are going to call "coarse additions" and keep consistent...try to understand/mimic the language used in other papers (almost done; need to do one more sweep)~~

- ~~ensure "coarse additions" is clearly defined~~


- ~~put D50 in 1st A lims figure / panels ~~

- ~~explain that A lims are % vs decimal~~ 

- ~~Lit review : must add some about toughness and then also link it to baseball fields and why we care~~


_____________



- ~~consider eliminating derivatives figure or using a table instead....maybe the prior figure is enough to tell the story~~

- ~~set up the linear law concept early in the paper and explain why it is used. The point of the linear law is because you HAVE to take out the coarse particles to perform the test, and it is the only approach to get the whole-soil LL or PL ~~

- bring the baseball thing back up in the conclusions
