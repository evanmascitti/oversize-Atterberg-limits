  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Resistance to shear was measured in a range of sand/soil mixes equilibrated at 5 cm, 20 cm and 60 cm water tension and compacted with a pressure of 3 x 104th Pa. The amount of fine material in the mix expressed as percent less than 50 um was correlated with resistance to shear. Over the range of water tensions examined, the higher the tension the greater the rate of increase in resistance to shear. At the lowest water tension of 5 cm resistance to shear, was low in the pure sand and increased steadily up to a fine material content of around 28\% after which stage resistance to shear decreased. At a tension of 60 cm, 12\% fine material increased resistance to shear approximatly two and a half fold over that of pure sand. Air dry sand offered a very low resistance to shear, only approximately 1/10th of that given at tensions of 30 cm and 60 cm. The practical implications of these results are discussed. The effects of 100 day old Lolium perenne 'Majestic' and Agrostis tenuis 'Highland' roots had very different effects on the resistance to shear of fine sand. The roots of 'Highland' gave an insignificant increase in resistance to shear whereas the roots of 'Majestic' increased resistance to shear by a greater amount than an incorporated 12\% fine material. The range weight of roots of 'Majestic' in the 0 - 2 cm depth range was closely correlated with resistance to shear and although total root weight was influenced by nitrogen supply level the weight of roots in the 0 - 2 depth range was not.}

  abstract = {In agriculture, the soil strength is used to describe the susceptibility to deformation by pressure caused by agricultural machine. The purpose of this study was to compare different methods for estimating the inherent soil strength and to identify their suitability for the evaluation of load support capacity, compaction susceptibility and root growth. The physical, chemical, mineralogical and intrinsic strength properties of seven soil samples, collected from five sampling pits at different locations in Brazil, were measured. Four clay (CS) and three sandy clay loam (SCL) soils were used. The clay soils were collected on a farm in Santo Ângelo, RS (28 ° 16 ' 16 '' S; 54 ° 13 ' 11 '' W 290 m); A and B horizons at the Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras, MG (21 ° 13 ' 47 '' S; 44 ° 58 ' 6'' W; 918 m) and on the farm Sygenta, in Uberlandia, MG (18 ° 58 ' 37 '' S; 48 ° 12 ' 05 '' W 866 m). The sandy clay loam soils were collected in Aracruz, ES (19 ° 47 ' 10 '' S; 40 ° 16 ' 29 '' W 81 m), and on the farm Xavier, Lavras, MG (21 ° 13 ' 24 '' S; 45 ° 05 ' 00 '' W; 844 m). Soil strength was estimated based on measurements of: (a) a pneumatic consolidometer, (b) manual pocket (non-rotating) penetrometer; and (c) automatic (rotating) penetrometer. The results of soil strength properties were similar by the three methods. The soil structure had a significant influence on soil strength. Results of measurements with both the manual pocket and the electric penetrometer were similar, emphasizing the influence of soil texture. The data showed that, to enhance the reliability of predictions of preconsolidation pressure by penetrometers, it is better to separate the soils into the different classes, rather than analyze them jointly. It can be concluded that the consolidometer method, although expensive, is the best when evaluations of load support capacity and compaction susceptibility of soil samples are desired. Na agricultura, a resistência do solo é usada para descrever a suscetibilidade a deformação através da pressão causada pelas máquinas agrícolas. Os objetivos deste estudo foram comparar diferentes métodos para estimar a resistência do solo e identificar suas potencialidades para avaliar a capacidade de suporte de carga, a suscetibilidade à compactação e o crescimento de raiz. Os atributos físicos, químicos, mineralógicos e de resistência de amostras de solo, coletadas em cinco trincheiras situadas em várias localidades no Brasil, foram medidos neste estudo. Quatro solos muito argilosos (CS) e três franco-argiloarenosos (SCL) foram usados. Os solos argilosos foram coletados em um Fazenda em Santo Ângelo, RS (28 ° 16 ' 16 '' S; 54 ° 13 ' 11 '' W; 290 m); e os horizontes A e B, na Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras, MG (21 ° 13 ' 47 '' S; 44 ° 58 ' 6 '' W; 918 m), e na Fazenda da Syngenta, Uberlândia, MG (18 ° 58 ' 37 '' S; 48 ° 12 ' 05 '' W; 866 m). Os solos franco-argiloarenosos foram coletados em Aracruz, ES (19 ° 47 ' 10 '' S; 40 ° 16 ' 29 '' W; 81 m), e na Fazenda Xavier, Lavras, MG (21 ° 13 ' 24 '' S; 45 ° 05 ' 00 '' W; 844 m). A resistência dos solos foi obtida com um consolidômetro pneumático, penetrômetro de bolso manual (não giratório) e um penetrômetro automatizado (giratório). Os resultados da resistência do solo foram similares nos três métodos. A estrutura do solo influenciou significativamente sua resistência. Medições com o penetrômetro de bolso manual e o automatizado produziram resultados semelhantes, indicando influência da textura do solo. Os resultados mostraram que, para aumentar a confiabilidade na predição da pressão de preconsolidação usando penetrômetros, é melhor separar os solos em diferentes classes texturais do que analisá-las juntas. Apesar de o método do consolidômetro ser caro, conclui-se que este é o melhor método quando são desejadas avaliações da capacidade de suporte de carga e da suscetibilidade à compactação do solo.

  abstract = {The effect of particle shape on the compressional properties of various batches of starch (Starch 1500; I), sodium chloride (II), lactose (III), and calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate (Emcompress; IV) was investigated and measurements of tensile strength, compressibility, elastic recovery, yield values and fragmentation propensities were made. For materials which consolidate by plastic deformation (I and II), there is a large increase in compressibility, a large decrease in yield values and a small decrease in elastic recovery in going from regular to irregular particles. This explains the observed increase in tensile strength which is due to the increased area of contact between particles as they deform. For materials which consolidate by fragmentation (III and IV), the shape of the particles has practically no effect on the above properties. However, the irregular particles are found to fracture more than the regular ones as shown by the values of Pfb and fragmentation propensity. (14 refs.) (Modified author abstract)},

Dynamic soil compactors create nonlinear vibrations, and the typical characteristics of these vibrations are taken as the basis for the feedback control system for intelligent compaction. With the model of the machine and the soil as the starting point, the periodic loss of contact between the drum and the subgrade is postulated to be the main nonlinear effect. This nonlinearity leads to near periodic and subharmonic vibration phenomena, and it can bring about unstable drum dynamics. The machine behavior can be investigated with the help of the chaos theory. Feedback control systems for rollers are based on the results from the theory of nonlinear oscillations, and they allow optimal compaction performance thanks to continuous adjustment to the compaction status. Starting with large amplitudes and low frequencies, the automatic control system ensures a good depth effect....},

  abstract = {The stability of natural Rugby Union pitches continues to be a recurring problem at all levels of the game. The effects of poor stability are seen when the pitch surface shears under player loading, creating unsightly divots and an uneven and potentially injurious surface. This observed instability is a real concern for many stakeholders, from the groundsmen to the revenue-generating television companies, and is arguably increasing caused by greater popularity of sports, more intensive use of natural turf pitches and advances in player physical conditioning. However, perhaps surprisingly, no objective quantitative mechanical test method currently exists for assessing the shear stability of the natural turf prior to games being played. This paper presents the findings from a (ongoing) research study into the design and development of a prototype turf stability apparatus ('Turf Tester'). The key aim was to measure the shearing stability of natural and hybrid turf in order to assess a recurring failure problem. In order to be relatable to sporting performance, this failure imitates conditions to simulate player(s) interaction. The prototype and test method was developed with properties suggested from published papers discussing rugby and agronomists' experience. It was theorized that there was a potential zone susceptible to failure within the top 100 mm of the sports turf. The position of this zone was variable and depended on pitch construction. The prototype was built to explore this variable failure zone using a 50 mm and 100 mm pin that sheared through the soil when a known load was applied to it. Both the Clegg Impact Hammer (CIH) and the rotational traction (RTD) were suggested to be relatable to penetration and shear stability; however, their relatability to the failure zone was an unknown. This paper details the background behind the study, the prototype design and principle, the observed failure mechanisms of sports turf, and presents the results of the prototype apparatus trailed on a range of turf constructions at venues used for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Data was collected at each venue using Labosport's Scoreplay system detailing full agronomic classifications and a suite of industry standard player performance tests. The combined data from 13 of the venues provided a powerful data set to evaluate and refine the prototype apparatus, providing validity of its conceptual design. The findings show that the shear tester assessed the upper level of ability of pitches with a 50 mm depth pin and the lower ability with the 100 mm pin. There was some evidence of a relationship to the CIH and RTD, albeit weak, and it was concluded the shear tester was assessing a characteristic of the sport turf not currently measured by standard industry tests currently utilized. The shear tester differentiated between the high stability of the hybrid pitch constructions and the weaker natural pitches. The shear tester rankings for pitch quality also approximated well the ranking from the Scoreplay pitch quality system. Incorporation of the shear tester into routine pitch evaluations could benefit a scoring system approach.},

Several measuring techniques and devices were proposed to determine the optimal water content in a clay body required to allow this body to be plastically deformed by shaping. In this review, methods of evaluating the plasticity of clay-water systems are presented. Despite the advance in the theory of the plasticity and the methods of measurement, a common procedure for all types of materials does not exist. The most important methods are those that simulate the conditions of real processing. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The sieve-pipette is the standard method for determining soil particle size distribution (PSD) because it is precise and reproducible. However, this method requires considerable time. Light diffraction methods for determining PSD are fast, but there is no standard procedure and often, results do not agree precisely with the pipette. The objective of this study was to develop a simple and fast procedure for sample handling and treatment of light diffraction method. A commercially available laser-light diffraction instrument was used. Soil samples were loaded dry into the instrument for ease and speed. A combination of chemical and physical dispersion within the instrument was found to be convenient and effective. Time required to analyze a sample was at most 15 min. Reproducibility between different operators was good, with S.E. ranging from 0.2\% to 3.6\%. Furthermore, we attempted to identify optimal values for the real refractive index and imaginary refractive index used in the optical model for light diffraction. Values of 1.42 and 0.001 for real refractive index and imaginary refractive index, respectively, were found to give acceptable results when compared with the pipette method. The light diffraction method was not significantly different from the pipette method for sand (P = 0.084), silt (P = 0.743), and clay (P = 0.052). Correlation between the light diffraction and pipette method for sand, silt, and clay was acceptable (R = 0.88, 0.80, and 0.69, respectively). The light diffraction technique does not have a perfect agreement with the pipette method, but it provides data rapidly and was reproducible. This method can be very valuable when a large number of samples need to be analyzed for relative comparisons between different sites. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

The control of tillering has proven to be multi-factorial and very complex. The physiological complexity of this process is demonstrated by the wide array of environmental, endogenous and biotic effects that, together with their interactions have been shown to modulate tillering. In this review we analyze current knowledge about the tillering process at both isolated plants and canopy levels, and discuss the opportunities for integrating experimental results into a unifying theory that cana ccount for all effects and thus overcome the shortcomings of the previously proposed nutritional and hormonal hypotheses. We discuss recent advances on the control of tiller development by endogenous, environmenta dn biotic factors at the isolated plant level, while the empirical rules that had been developed to allow proper tiller management at a canopy level are presented in connection with available physiological basis. Attentiaon is also given to the recent development of simulation models that provide a powerful tool for agronomic management of tiller dynamics, which in turn may facilitate, through their validation, new insigths on the control of tillering by the plant.},

The participation of other hormones is less clear, but there is evidence that gibberellins may also play a role, as suggested by earlier tillering in plants treated with gibberellin synthesis inhibitors. This study evaluates the effect of paclobutrazol (PBZ), a gibberellin synthesis inhibitor, on tiller development in wheat. Experiments were conducted under controlled conditions, and PBZ was supplied to the root medium. PBZ caused a significant advancement of the onset of tillering compared with the controls. However, no effects on site filling were observed. Earlier tillering in PBZ-treated plants was associated with a promotive effect on the rate of leaf appearance. PBZ-treated plants had lower height, higher chlorophyll content, a trend to a higher quantum yield of photosystem II, increased dry matter content and a higher concentration of soluble sugars. The results suggest that an increased carbohydrate status in PBZ-treated plants may lead to a faster leaf and tiller development without modifying site filling. A proposed model of the relationships between gibberellins, carbohydrates, rate of leaf appearance and tillering is discussed.},

NOTE 1—The equipment and procedures are similar as those proposed by R. R. Proctor (Engineering News Record—September 7, 1933) with this one major exception: his rammer blows were applied as " 12 inch firm strokes " instead of free fall, producing variable compactive effort depend-ing on the operator, but probably in the range 15,000 to 25,000 ft-lbf/ft},

  abstract = {This standard describes a system for classifying mineral and organo-mineral soils for engineering purposes based on laboratory determination of particle-size characteristics, liquid limit, and plasticity index and shall be used when precise classification is required. Note 1-Use of this standard will result in a single classification group symbol and group name except when a soil contains 5 to 12\% fines or when the plot of the liquid limit and plasticity index values falls into the crosshatched area of the plasticity chart. In these two cases, a dual symbol is used, for example, GP-GM, CL-ML. When the laboratory test results indicate that the soil is close to another soil classification group, the borderline condition can be indicated with two symbols separated by a slash. The first symbol should be the one based on this standard, for example, CL/CH, GM/SM, SC/CL. Borderline symbols are particularly useful when the liquid limit value of clayey soils is close to 50. These soils can have expansive characteristics and the use of a borderline symbol (CL/CH, CH/CL) will alert the user of the assigned classifications of expansive potential. 1.2 The group symbol portion of this sytem is based on laboratory tests performed on the portion of a soil sample passing the 3-in. (75-mm) sieve (see Specification E11). 1.3 As a classification system, this standard is limited to naturally occurring soils. Note 2-The group names and symbols used in this test method may be used as a descriptive system applied to such materials as shale, claystone, shells, crushed rock, etc. See Appendix X2. 1.4 This standard is for qualitative application only. Note 3-When quantitative information is required for detailed designs of important structures, this test method must be supplemented by laboratory tests or other quantitative data to determine performance characteristics under expected field conditions. 1.5 This standard is the ASTM version of the Unified Soil Classification System. The basis for the classification scheme is the Airfield Classification System developed by A. Casagrande in the early 1940's. It became known as the Unified Soil Classification System when several U.S. Government Agencies adopted a modified version of the Airfield System in 1952. 1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety problems, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.},

  abstract = {Abstract\textbackslash nFrom a biophysical perspective, woody biomass resources are large enough to cover a substantial share of the world's primary energy consumption in 2050. However, these resources have alternative uses and their accessibility is limited, which tends to decrease their competitiveness with respect to other forms of energy. Hence, the key question of woody biomass use for energy is not the amount of resources, but rather their price. In this study we consider the question from the perspective of energy wood supply curves, which display the available amount of woody biomass for large-scale energy production at various hypothetical energy wood prices. These curves are estimated by the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), which is a global partial equilibrium model of forest and agricultural sectors. The global energy wood supply is estimated to be 0–23 Gm3/year (0–165 EJ/year) when energy wood prices vary in a range of 0–30\$/GJ (0–216\$/m3). If we add household fuelwood to energy wood, then woody biomass could satisfy 2–18\% of world primary energy consumption in 2050. If primary forests are excluded from wood supply then the potential decreases up to 25\%.},

Participants solved mathematics problems that were presented as either multiple-choice or open-ended questions, and were provided with one of four types of feedback: no feedback (NF), immediate knowledge of the correct response (KCR), multiple-try feedback with knowledge of the correct response (MTC), or multiple-try feedback with hints after an initial incorrect response (MTH). Results showed that gains in performance were larger in the open-ended than multiple-choice condition. Furthermore, gains under NF and KCR were similar, gains were larger under MTC than KCR, and gains were larger under MTH than MTC. The implications of these results for the design of assessments for learning are discussed.},

Soils with higher organic matter contents generally had lower bulk density and higher moisture contents after pitch preparation. Patterns of soil cracking appeared to be related to soil strength and shrinkage rates for some soils, although the results were not consistent for all the materials examined. Organic matter content had a much greater effect on hardness and ball rebound than clay content and indeed the soil containing only 24\%clay gave some ofthe highest readings ofball rebound. Ball rebound and hardness were strongly influenced by soil moisture content following pitch prepara- tion. There were no consistent patterns in terms ofbaillsurface friction that could be related to possible variations in the capacity ofeach soil to take spin.},

There was some evidence that the presence of a more moisture-retentive soil within the base layer was associated with higher organic matter content in the overlying soil.

To facilitate reproducible research, rather than employing a relatively ad-hoc point-and-click cut-and-paste approach, we typically break down these tasks into manageable chunks by employing separate files of statistical, programming or text processing syntax for each step including the final report. Real world data analysis often requires an iterative process because many of these steps may need to be repeated any number of times. Manually repeating these steps is problematic in that some necessary steps may be left out or some reported results may not be for the most recent data set or syntax. GNU Make may be used to automate the mundane task of regenerating output given dependencies between syntax and data files. In addition to facilitating the management of and documenting the workflow of a complex data analysis project, such automation can help minimize errors and make the project more reproducible. It is relatively simple to construct Makefiles for small data analysis projects. As projects increase in size, difficulties arise because GNU Make does not have inbuilt rules for statistical and related software. Without such rules, Makefiles can become unwieldy and error-prone. This article addresses these issues by providing GNU Make pattern rules for R, Sweave, rmarkdown, SAS, Stata, Perl and Python to streamline management of data analysis and reporting projects. Rules are used by adding a single line to project Makefiles. Additional flexibility is incorporated for modifying standard program options. An overall strategy is outlined for Makefile construction and illustrated via simple and complex examples.},

The KC and DC green bodies were passed through an extruder, and cylindrical clay green bodies having different moisture contents were obtained and used in the experiments. The yield stresses (σ0.2) were determined from the compression tests. Plastic tensile strain limit values (εθ*) were determined from the upset tests. The product of the two characteristic values, σ0.2εθ*, was defined as the workability. The variation of the σ0.2, εθ* and σ0.2εθ* values as a function of the moisture content of the green bodies was discussed for KC and DC. From the maxima of the σ0.2 curves, the optimum moisture percentages were determined as 22.0 and 26.5 for the KC and DC, respectively.

The rhizotron facility has two observation rooms, each containing 20 removable root cell containers. Root cell container variation, rhizotron observation room vertical and horizontal temperature gradients, soil temperature profile of the root cell containers versus the adjacent soil, vertical and horizontal temperature gradients within root cell containers, and root cell container media were investigated in the facility.\^ A complete randomized design was used due to a low coefficient of variation between root cell containers of 0.58. The rhizotron observation room without circulation had a mean vertical gradient of 1.1 C in a diurnal cycle. With air circulation the mean vertical temperature gradient was reduced to 0.3 C. Horizontal temperature differences in the observation room had a standard deviation of 0.13. Daily mean temperatures in the observation room ranged from 0.1 to 16.3 C warmer than ambient temperature.\^ Soil temperatures were assessed with thermocouples placed at five levels (i.e. vertical gradient) and three positions per level (i.e. horizontal gradient) in each root cell container. Mean temperature for horizontal gradient had no biological significance at the 25, 300, 600, and 1200 mm level. The 5 mm level had horizontal differences of 2.1 C with biological significance. Soil temperatures in the root cell containers differed from the adjacent soil. Containers had higher temperatures at the 300, 600, and 1200 mm levels than the soil profile due to the observation room influence. Insulation of the root cell container reduced the observation room influence.\^ Silica sand; fritted clay; washed, river-sand; and sand/soil media had different soil temperature profiles. Fritted clay had the lowest temperatures at the 5 and 25 mm levels for the media tested. Media influence on soil temperature declined with depth.\^ Turfgrass growing in fritted clay had the greatest root length in the upper portion of the profile, but sand/soil mix had the greatest total root length. The fritted clay was the best medium with superior topgrowth, lower temperatures, acceptable root growth, lowest bulk density, and ease of handling. \^}

From nominal stresses applied during rolling and changes in diameter measured for each rolling traverse the toughness of the clay is determined from the stress-strain curves, as work/unit volume for a specified amount of deformation. Threads are tested at water contents ranging from near the sticky limit through the workable plastic region to the brittle state. An abrupt ductile-brittle or plastic-brittle transition is found allowing the plastic limit to be defined as the transition water content. A less abrupt but distinct stiffness transition is frequently obtained that separates the workable plastic region into a soft-plastic and a stiff-plastic region. Good relationships between toughness and water content are achieved from which the maximum toughness, Tmax, at the plastic limit is derived together with other new and useful properties such as the water content at the stiffness transition, wS and at zero toughness, the toughness limit, wT. Also derived are the gradients of the relationships, the toughness coefficients, TC, the range of water contents over which the clay is plastic and tough, the toughness index, IT and the water content in relation to the toughness index, the workability index, Iw. Each clay is found to have a closely correlated toughness-water content relationship depending mainly on the clay content and clay mineralogy demonstrating that control of the plasticity of the clay and its associated water contents are achievable. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In different studies other methods have been put forward; however, these methods cannot compete with the thread rolling test in simplicity, execution time and cost. In this article an accurate, quick and simple method is presented with a simple device for determining the plastic limit of soils, in which the subjective point of view of the operator is omitted. Soil threads which are 3mm in diameter and 52mm long are bent until they start to crack. The relationship between the bending produced, B, and water content, W, has been studied, in such a way that the plastic limit, PL, and another two new parameters (the stiff-soft limit, SSL, and the bend-breaking limit, BL) have been determined with minimal operator interference. These new parameters delimit other consistency states, which may be very useful in sectors such as the ceramics industry, agriculture or geotechnical engineering. The PL results obtained by the bending test in 24 soils concur to a great degree with those obtained in the thread rolling test by a highly experienced operator (R2=0.972). Moreover, these results have been endorsed by Shapiro–Wilk and Student's T statistics tests. Finally, the reliability of the method using only 3 and 1 experimental points has been studied too which have yielded very similar results to those obtained with 6 and 7 points.},

The effects of blending different clays with a range of proportions have been investigated on the Atterberg plasticity limits and on the toughness-water content relationships. It is demonstrated that blending of raw and processed clays with different mineralogy and plasticity properties can produce liquid and plastic limits and toughness-water content relationships that do not follow a linear interpolation between the individual properties of the clays in relation to their proportions. Mixing of high plasticity clay with a lower plasticity clay produced a wider range of water contents over which the mixtures remained plastic, particularly with lower water contents which would be desirable when considering shrinkage properties. However, this resulted in increased toughness and harder workability, a less desirable factor.},

  abstract = {The standard plastic limit test, based on Atterberg’s original manual thread rolling method, is a simple, quick, and inexpensive procedure that has received very little attention for improvement since its initial inception over a century ago even though it receives much criticism because of its poor reproducibility. An investigation into the shortcomings of the standard test by means of manual rolling path tests examines the relationships between the water content, diameter and condition of soil threads, and the distinct ductile–brittle transition that occurs at the plastic limit. The ASTM and International Standards are compared, highlighting significant differences in their procedures. Modifications of the standard method are recommended to provide coherent objectives for a consistent rolling procedure, compatible considerations of diameter, and a more precise and authentic assessment of the end criterion at the plastic limit.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

Simply put, these technologies allow for the digital capture of an object's natural surface geometry. This article presents methods concerning the 3D scanning techniques using structured light, in which different patterns or structures are projected onto the scene to be scanned. The deformation of the original structure, as it falls upon the scanning scene, can be used to recover the scene's geometry. Within structured light technologies, there are several well-developed approaches in the design of the pattern(s) that are cast upon a scene. Some of the approaches offer significant advantages, such as the ability to capture the 3D geometry of a scene at very high accuracies at real-time rates. Given these advantages, the adoption of such 3D structured light technologies has been increasing. Being so, this article will also detail applications in which 3D structured light techniques are currently being employed within the fields of medicine, biology, manufacturing, security, communications, remote environment reconstruction, and consumer electronics.},

  abstract = {The Robinson pipette method (Pipette) is accurate and precise but time consuming. Bouyoucos (1936) proposed a more rapid and simpler procedure called the hydrometer method. Both analytical techniques are sedimentation procedures accepted as standard techniques for particle-size analysis. The sand, silt, and clay contents of several soil samples were determined using the Pipette method as a control and compared with the Bouyoucus, the Bouyoucos Modified (Bouyoucos\_M) and the Bouyoucos Modified with gravimetric determination of the sand content (Bouyoucos\_M-T) methods. Data obtained from these procedures was used to assess soil textural class, the soil erodibility coefficient (K), the water retained at field capacity (FC) and the permanent wilting point (PWP). In the Bouyoucos\_M method, the soil organic matter (SOM) was destroyed and the dispersingagent concentration was increased. In the Bouyoucos\_M-T method, the sand was quantified gravimetrically by sieving samples through a 53 µm mesh. The hydrometer and Pipette methods measurements correlated well. The Bouyoucos and the Bouyoucus-M methods overestimated the sand content. The performance of the Bouyoucos\_M-T method did not differ from that of the Pipette method. Compared with the Pipette method, the Bouyoucus method underestimated the clay content, and the Bouyoucos\_M method did not differ from the Pipette method. The values obtained with the Bouyoucos\_M and the Bouyoucos methods underestimated the FC and the PWP, and Bouyoucos\_M-T method did not differ from estimations based on the Pipette method data. The assessed K value was underestimated with the Bouyoucos\_M method. The Bouyoucos and the Bouyoucos\_M-T methods estimated the K values similar to the Pipette method. The Bouyucus\_M-T method is suitable for determining the soil texture and inferring soil properties but is unacceptable for assessing the class texture for soil taxonomic classification.   ~  El método de la Pipeta de Robinson (Pipeta) es exacto y preciso, pero insume mucho tiempo. Bouyoucos (1936) propuso el método del hidrómetro como más rápido y simple. Ambos métodos de sedimentación se aceptan para el~ análisis textural del suelo. Se comparó el contenido de arena, limo y arcilla de varias muestras de suelo. Se asumió el método de la Pipeta como control y se comparó con: Bouyoucus; una modificación de Bouyoucos, con destrucción de materia orgánica y mayor concentración de dispersante (Bouyoucos\_M); y Bouyoucos\_M con determinación gravimétrica de arena previo tamizado de las muestras con malla de 53 µm (Bouyoucos\_M-T). Los datos se emplearon para evaluar: clase textural; coeficiente de erodabilidad (K); agua retenida a capacidad de campo (CC); y el punto de marchitez permanente (PMP). Hubo buena correlación entre las mediciones con hidrómetro y la Pipeta. El método Bouyoucos o Bouyoucus-M sobreestimó el contenido de arena, pero Bouyoucos\_M-T no difirió. Bouyoucus subestimó el contenido de arcilla y Bouyoucos\_M no difirió. Con los datos de Bouyoucos\_M y Bouyoucos se subestimaron FC y PWP; con Bouyoucos\_M-T no hubo diferencias de las estimaciones al comparar con la Pipeta. Se subestimó el coeficiente K al utilizar los datos de Bouyoucos\_M. Con Bouyoucos o Bouyoucos\_M-T, los valores estimados de K no difirieron de los estimados a partir de la Pipeta. Bouyucus\_M-T fue adecuado para inferir las propiedades del suelo, pero inaceptable para adjudicar la clase textural con el fin de clasificar suelo con fines taxonómicos.},

  abstract = {Modern sand-based golf course putting greens are constructed for optimum soil physical properties. However, since they are sand based and synthetically prepared, it is often perceived that they support a less numerous and diverse microbial population than comparable native soils. This field study was conducted to monitor the microbial properties of five newly constructed sand-based rootzone mixtures planted to creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera var. palustris Huds. Farw.) during the first 2 yr of turfgrass establishment. Bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and aerobic spore forming (Bacillus spp.) populations were determined on selective media. Nitrifiers and denitrifiers were estimated by a most probable number (MPN) technique. Within the first 6 mo after seeding, bacteria exceeded 108 cfu gϪ1 dry soil, similar to levels recorded in a mature sand-based putting green. Bacteria were most numerous followed by actinomycetes, fungi, and Bacillus spp., respectively. Temporal changes in microbial populations were observed only in year one. The nitrogen transforming populations were numerically smaller (Ͻ104 cfu gϪ1 dry soil) than total bacteria but followed a similar temporal trend. Rootzone amendments had minimal effects on microbial properties but environmental factors and an actively growing turfgrass root system may have a greater influence on microbial activity.},

  abstract = {There are many instruments for particle size distribution (PSD) measurement, each using a particular physical phenomenon to define the size (e.g., sedimentation, laser diffraction). Particle size distribution measurement although important, most people want it done as quickly as possible. This paper will compare rapid methods [laser diffraction and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS)] with sedimentation techniques and image analysis. Nanometer powders (primary particles 10-50 nm) have been studied using, photocentrifuge, PCS, and x-ray disc centrifuge. The median diameters are very consistent for all instruments for narrow size distributions at around 20 nm but a divergence of results for the 50 nm range when distributions are broader. Comparison with image analysis for a spherical silica (50 nm) illustrates the accuracy possible in this domain. In the 0.1 to 5 micron range examples showing how the width and size range of the particle size distribution of typical commercial aluminas and calcites, can influence greatly the reported values from different instruments will be presented. The resolution and accuracy of PSD measurement for laser diffraction has been investigated using spherical glass beads ranging from 70 to 400 μm, sieved into five fractions. Particle size distributions measured by image analysis are compared with the laser diffraction results. The shape also has a profound effect on the interpretation of data provided by commercial instruments which ordinarily assume a spherical shape. Results for plate and rod like particles will be presented and the most appropriate method for the shapes suggested.},

Civilizations all around the world showed various levels of soil knowledge by the 4th century AD, including irrigation, the use of terraces to control erosion, various ways of improving soil fertility, and ways to create productive artificial soils. Early soils knowledge was largely based on observations of nature; experiments to test theories were not conducted. Many famous scientists, for example, Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, Charles Darwin, and Leonardo da Vinci worked on soils issues. Soil science did not become a true science, however, until the 19th century with the development of genetic soil science, led by Vasilii V. Dokuchaev. In the 20th century, soil science moved beyond its agricultural roots and soil information is now used in residential development, the planning of highways, building foundations, septic systems, wildlife management, environmental management, and many other applications in addition to agriculture. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Little information is available regarding the effects of varying construction and maintenance practices on the pace of baseball playing surfaces. Research was conducted to evaluate the effects of construction and maintenance practices on a non-turfed basepath, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) turf, and six synthetic turf surfaces. Factors evaluated on the non-turfed basepath included soil compaction at installation, surface scarification, and topdressing with a soil conditioner (calcined clay). The effects of cutting height and thatch thickness were evaluated on Kentucky bluegrass, while the effects of simulated traffic and grooming were evaluated on synthetic turf. On the non-turfed basepath, increasing soil compaction yielded increases in surface pace. Calcined clay topdressing and increasing scarification depth did not affect surface pace. On Kentucky bluegrass, varying cutting height and thatch thickness levels had no effect on surface pace. On synthetic turf, increases in simulated traffic resulted in slight increases in pace. Surface pace measurements on synthetic turf were less variable than those made on natural turfgrass. The results indicate that the pace of commonly used baseball playing surfaces is not easily altered with minimally invasive maintenance procedures and should be addressed at construction or during aggressive renovations .

For example, improvements in LiDAR data resolution may make it possible to accurately model microtopography over a large geographic area; however, data resolution and processing costs versus resulting accuracy may be too costly. We examined two LiDAR datasets of differing resolutions, a low point density (0.714 points/m2 spacing) 1 m DEM available statewide in Pennsylvania and a high point density (10.28 points/m2 spacing) 1 m DEM research-grade DEM, and compared the calculated roughness between both resulting DEMs using standard deviation of slope, standard deviation of curvature, a pit fill index, and the difference between a smoothed splined surface and the original DEM. These results were then compared to field-surveyed plots and transects of microterrain. Using both datasets, patterns of roughness were identified, which were associated with different landforms derived from hydrogeomorphic features such as stream channels, gullies, and depressions. Lowland areas tended to have the highest roughness values for all methods, with other areas showing distinctive patterns of roughness values across metrics. However, our results suggest that the high-resolution research-grade LiDAR did not improve roughness modeling in comparison to the coarser statewide LiDAR. We conclude that resolution and initial point density may not be as important as the algorithm and methodology used to generate a LiDAR-derived DEM for roughness modeling purposes. © 2013 Kristen M.

  abstract = {Inferred dietary preference is a major component of paleoecologies of extinct primates. Molar occlusal shape correlates with diet in living mammals, so teeth are a potentially useful structure from which to reconstruct diet in extinct taxa. We assess the efficacy of Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) calculated for molar tooth surfaces for reflecting diet. We evaluate DNE, which uses changes in normal vectors to characterize curvature, by directly comparing this metric to metrics previously used in dietary inference. We also test whether combining methods improves diet reconstructions. The study sample consisted of 146 lower (mandibular) second molars belonging to 24 euarchontan taxa. Five shape quantification metrics were calculated on each molar: DNE, shearing quotient, shearing ratio, relief index, and orientation patch count rotated (OPCR). Statistical analyses were completed for each variable to assess effects of taxon and diet. Discriminant function analysis was used to assess ability of combinations of variables to predict diet. Values differ significantly by diets for all variables, although shearing ratios and OPCR do not distinguish statistically between insectivores and folivores or omnivores and frugivores. Combined analyses were much more effective at predicting diet than any metric alone. Alone, relief index and DNE were most effective at predicting diet. OPCR was the least effective alone but is still valuable as the only quantitative measure of surface complexity. Of all methods considered, DNE was the least methodologically sensitive, and its effectiveness suggests it will be a valuable tool for dietary reconstruction. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Cultural management of weeds in turfgrass is the use of mowing, fertilization, irrigation, cultivation, planting, and turfgrass selection to affect weed populations. There is consensus in the literature on a few cultural factors influencing some weeds in cool-season turfgrasses. Taller mowing height, 4 to 8 cm, depending on turfgrass, reduces populations of crabgrasses (Digitaria spp.) in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and fescues (Festuca spp.). A high rate of N fertilization (100-300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) reduces populations of crabgrasses, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale G.H. Weber ex Wiggers), and other broadleaf weeds in cool-season turfgrasses. Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) may be favored by this high rate of fertilization. Fertilization of turfgrasses when they are not actively growing increases weeds. Slow-growing grasses such as zoysiagrasses (Zoysia spp.) have more weeds at high N fertilization rate. Environmental stresses including drought injury, unnecessary aeration or vertical mowing, biotic stress such as nematode and insect herbivory, and diseases contribute to weed colonization. Adapted cultivars and species of turfgrasses that are genetically resistant to biotic and environmental stresses have the fewest weed problems. Adapted turfgrasses can sometimes be effectively managed in the absence of herbicides, especially if they are well established. The generalized mechanisms for cultural management of weeds are poorly understood. Research is needed on optimizing the choices of herbicide and/or cultural practices as part of an integrated management system for turfgrass.},

First, participants read 12 prose passages, which covered various general knowledge topics (e.g., The Sun) and ranged between 280 and 300 words in length. Next, they took an initial six-alternative, multiple-choice test on information contained in the passages. Feedback was given immediately for some of the multiple-choice items or after delay for other items. Participants were either shown the correct answer as feedback (standard feedback) or were allowed to keep answering until the correct answer was discovered (answer-until-correct feedback). Learning from the test was assessed on a delayed cued-recall test. The results indicated that delayed feedback led to superior final test performance relative to immediate feedback. However, type of feedback did not matter: discovering the correct answer through answer-until-correct feedback produced equivalent performance relative to standard feedback. This research suggests that delaying the presentation of feedback after a test is beneficial to learning because of the spaced presentation of information. © 2007 American Psychological Association.},

Multiple-choice testing enhances retention of the material tested (the testing effect); however, unlike other tests, multiple-choice can also be detrimental because it exposes students to misinformation in the form of lures. The selection of lures can lead students to acquire false knowledge (Roediger \& Marsh, 2005). The present research investigated whether feedback could be used to boost the positive effects and reduce the negative effects of multiple-choice testing. Subjects studied passages and then received a multiple-choice test with immediate feedback, delayed feedback, or no feedback. In comparison with the no-feedback condition, both immediate and delayed feedback increased the proportion of correct responses and reduced the proportion of intrusions (i.e., lure responses from the initial multiple-choice test) on a delayed cued recall test. Educators should provide feedback when using multiple-choice tests. Copyright 2008 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

The drying state paths of normally consolidated reconstituted clay samples are plotted together with the corresponding isotropic normal compression lines, assuming equivalence between suction and effective stress for a fully saturated soil.

In four experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of rereading relative to a single reading in a context paralleling that faced by students in the classroom. Participants read educational texts (textbook chapters or a Scientific American article) under intentional learning instructions. Learning and memory were tested with educationally relevant summative assessments (multiple choice, short-answer questions, and text summaries). With only several exceptions, rereading did not significantly increase performance on the assessments. We also found that reading comprehension ability did not alter this pattern. It appears that when using ecologically valid materials such as a textbook chapter, immediate rereading may have little or no benefit for improving performance on educationally relevant summative assessments. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The C of P path in the rearfoot group showed a continuous anterior movement during support while the C of P in most of the midfoot group migrated posteriorly during the first 20 ms of the support phase. Variability in both groups was most marked during early support. The mean peak to peak force components were 3 Bq 1 BW and 0.3 BW in the vertical, anteroposterior and mediolateral directions respectively. Consistent differences between groups were noted in all three components, but individual differences within a given group were also considerable. The C of P patterns are presented in conjunction with ground reaction force data, and the implications of the results in the areas of running mechanics, shoe design and sports injury are discussed.},

This clay exhibited complicated volumetric response to wetting-drying cycles such as irreversible swelling upon wetting, irreversible shrinkage upon subsequent drying and accumulated swelling after a wetting-drying-wetting cycle. The wetting-induced irreversible swelling contributes to a significant reduction in pre-consolidation stress. It was observed that a wetting-drying cycle leads to a smaller pre-consolidation stress and downward shifting of the post-yield compression curve at a given suction, whereas a wetting-drying-wetting cycle shows an opposite effect. These observations are attributed to both irreversible swelling and irreversible change in the degree of saturation resulting from wetting-drying cycles. It was found that irreversible swelling or an irreversible increase in degree of saturation makes the soil more susceptible to yield, exhibiting a softening effect. Regarding water phase, its response to isotropic compression is mostly related to the recent wetting-drying history rather than the overall wetting-drying history. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Drought stress encumbers the growth of turfgrass principally by disrupting the plant-water relations and physiological functions. The present study was carried out to appraise the role of silicon (Si) in improving the drought tolerance in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.). Drought stress and four levels (0, 200, 400, and 800\,mg\,L(-1)) of Si (Na2SiO3·9H2O) were imposed after 2 months old plants cultured under glasshouse conditions. Drought stress was found to decrease the photosynthesis, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, leaf water content, relative growth rate, water use efficiency, and turf quality, but to increase in the root/shoot and leaf carbon/nitrogen ratio. Such physiological interferences, disturbances in plant water relations, and visually noticeable growth reductions in Kentucky bluegrass were significantly alleviated by the addition of Si after drought stress. For example, Si application at 400\,mg\,L(-1) significantly increased the net photosynthesis by 44\%, leaf water contents by 33\%, leaf green color by 42\%, and turf quality by 44\% after 20 days of drought stress. Si application proved beneficial in improving the performance of Kentucky bluegrass in the present study suggesting that manipulation of endogenous Si through genetic or biotechnological means may result in the development of drought resistance in grasses.},

This paper draws from the rural press, regional agricultural societies, and the first wave of state scientific surveys in that era to discuss the early Republic foundations of those new sciences. It discusses the dynamic and productive circulation of soil-based studies in an era that made it possible for later professional scientific activities to gain influence. It also suggests by way of conclusion that soil scientists and geologists of the twenty-first century can culturally ground their own activities more fully by articulating the purposes of their work as part of broader moral imperatives. To do this, they can treat new calls for sustainability science as a current version of improvement. By recognizing the fundamentally dual aims of sustainability-materially, to achieve the protection of resources and, culturally, to make progress toward more sustainable social structures-soil scientists and geologists can recall the common purpose of their work and avoid the distance from collective cultural activity that professional specialization of the last century and a half has brought. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In particular, the package provides a broad range of color palettes based on the HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) color space. The three HCL dimensions have been shown to match those of the human visual system very well, thus facilitating intuitive selection of color palettes through trajectories in this space. Using the HCL color model general strategies for three types of palettes are implemented: (1) Qualitative for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available.

  abstract = {Effect of aging on the intestinal permeability to medium size [3H]polyethylene glycol (PEG 900) was examined in vivo by gavage and in vitro in intestinal everted sacs of rats ranging in age from 5 to 102 weeks. Rats were gavaged with PEG 900 solution and urinary recovery of PEG 900 was measured for 6 hr in order to assess its absorption. Young rats, 5-.15 weeks of age, absorbed 1-1.3\% of administered PEG 900. In contrast, rats 35-102 weeks of age absorbed 1.8-2.4\% of administered PEG 900 (P {$<$} 0.05 vs younger animals). The increased absorption of PEG 900 with aging is due to changes in intestinal permeability since the total uptake (serosal appearance + tissue uptake) of PEG 900 by jejunum, ileum, and colonic everted sacs was significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in older rats (100 weeks) than young rats (9 1\textasciitilde{} weeks), while urinary excretion of PEG 900 following intravenous injection was the same in the two age groups. These studies indicate that aging rats have diminished capacity to exclude larger size molecules from penetrating the intestinal mucosa. The diminished barrier functions of the small intestine with aging may allow antigenic or mutagenic compounds to reach the systemic circulation. Polyethylene glycol 900 (PEG 900), which is a mixture o:f molecules with molecular weight of 800-1000 daltons, is an ideal intestinal permeability probe because of its water solubility and because its absorption follows first-order kinetics (1). More-over, PEG 900 is nontoxic, nondegradable by intes-tinal bacteria, does not undergo metabolism after absorption, and is rapidly and completely excreted in the urine after intravenous administration (1-4). Since changes in many aspects of intestinal func-tions have been found with aging (5-8), we exam-ined intestinal permeability with aging using PEG 900 as a probe. We used gastric gavage or infusion of PEG 900 solution because of the rapid absorp-tion, transport, and excretion of the molecules},

The mass of the striking implement is replaced by its effective mass, the latter quantity depending primarily on the “swing weight” of the implement and the location of the impact point. For normal or perpendicular impacts, energy loss can be described in terms of the normal coefficient of restitution, ey, or an equivalent “bounce factor”, q. For oblique impacts, the outgoing speed and spin of the ball also depends on the tangential coefficient of restitution, ex. Examples from baseball, tennis and other sports are highlighted},

Four different clays were studied and the plasticity values due to the Pfefferkorn method and the indentation test were compared.

S is equal to the slope of the water retention curve at its inflection point. The retention curve must be plotted as the logarithm (to base e) of the water potential against the gravimetric water content (kg kg-1). The use of S is illustrated with examples of soils with different friabilities, tillage at different water contents and the aggregate size distribution resulting from tillage. It is shown that friability, and hence the ease of working of the soil, is linearly and positively correlated with S. It is also shown in a short theoretical study that S can be used in a simple equation for estimation of the hard-setting behaviour of soil on drying. In combination with pedo-transfer functions, this enables the hard-setting behaviours of soils of different textures to be predicted and shows how hard-setting may be expected to increase with soil compaction. However, the predictions of hard-setting should be considered as speculative until they have been tested experimentally. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {By considering the worldwide use of composite materials in stabilization works, according to sustainable and ecological principles, the present paper is focused on the analysis of changes of several geotechnical properties depending on components of bi-mineral mixtures and interaction existing among various mineral types. Correlations of soil geotechnical indices as plasticity limits, particle size distributions, linear swelling and chemical-mineralogical composition have been determined for two clay bi-mineral mixtures (montmorillonite-illite and kaolinite-illite). Dependency of plasticity limits with mineralogical compositions and ion nature in absorption complex and linear relations between activity factor and liquid limit - plasticity index have been carried out. Effect of moisture content on soil properties, which influenced the aggregation or dispersion processes, has been investigated through a parallel preparation of samples resulting from the mixing of the component material in dry and wet state. Analysis of swelling characteristics has indicated various behaviors of clay soils depending on type and amount of mineral components. The influence of adsorbed ions on physical and mechanical soil characteristics on clay mineral mixtures, as well as long-term structural variations have been studied. The results will lead to improvement of material performances used in stabilization according to internal soil changes mixture behavior.},

  abstract = {As the water content is increased, the consistency of a fine-grained soil changes from a semi-solid state to a plastic state and finally to a liquid state. The plastic limit (PL) is the point at which the consistency, caused by the soil water content, is transformed from a semi-solid state to a plastic state. The liquid limit (LL) is the point at which the consistency is transformed from a plastic state to a liquid state. The plastic limit and liquid limit are often collectively referred to as the Atterberg (or consistency) Limits. Although the liquid and plastic limits are easily determined, fundamental interpretations of the limits and quantitative relationships between their values and compositional factors are more complex. Previous studies examined artificially-prepared soil samples that contained monomineralic clays and a non-clay substance (quartz sand). These studies have shown that in soils without expandable clays the PL and LL water contents were mostly related to surface area and clay content. For soils that contain expandable clays, the PL and LL values are also dependent on interlayer water content. Hence, expandable clay mineral contents are needed to calculate PL and LL values. These relationships have been presented in a general analytical form. The aim of these investigations was to identify practical applications. Mineral compositions and surface areas of five randomly selected natural soil samples were used to estimate PL and LL values. The estimated values were compared to experimentally measured liquid limits (by the 'fallcone' test) and plastic limit (by the 'rolling thread' test) values. The measured PL values ranged from 18.77 to 44.92\% and the LL values from 31.19 to 82.10\%. The differences between estimated and measured Atterberg Limits were 3.0-7.1 \% for the PL and 2.7-7.8\% for the LL. Minor differences in measured and estimated Atterberg Limits were probably due to soil organic matter (1.2-2.7\%). Copyright © 2007, The Clay Minerals Society.},

Objectiws:To investigatethe relationshipbetween static and dynamic foot postures; to determine the occurrence of abnormal foot postures in professionalbaseball playersand the incidenceof overuse injuries in the lower extremity; and to compare the foot postures of pitchers to those of positional players. Methodsa d Mewres: The foot postures of 74 professionalbaseball playerswere evaluatedat rest and during gait. Measures of static foot posture were obtained with a goniometer and includedthe subtalar neutralposition, forefooVrearfootposition, ankle joint dorsiflexion, tibia1angle in standing, and calcaneal angle in standing. The FootTrak motion analysis system provided measuresof dynamic foot posture (rearfoot supinationand pronation) during the stance phase of gait. A questionnaire was completedby players who reported previous lower extremity injuries.The chi-square statistic was used to determine the associations between forefoot position (varus or valgus) and the amount of foot pronation during gait. Results: The forefoot varus and calcaneal valgus in standing was significantly associated with the maximum pronation during the stance phase of gait. Of the 65 players who demonstrated excessive pronation ({$>$} 8 degrees), 28 (43\%) also reported a previous lower extremity injury. No statistically significant difference occurred, however, between injuredand uninjuredplayers with respect to the mean values of static or dynamic foot posture. In addition, foot postures were not associated with a player's position. Conclusions: Selected measures of static rearfoot and forefoot postures may have value in predicting dynamic rearfoot movement during the stance phase of gait. Excessivepronation in the baseball players we studied was not found to be a significant contributingfactor in the development of overuse injuries.) Orthop Spom Phys Ther 1999;29:316-330.},

It is shown that the log-hyperbolic function permits a satisfactory representation of all size distributions studied in this work. Hence, it appears that experimental particle size distributions are well described by the four characteristic parameters occurring in the log-hyperbolic function. These parameters can therefore be employed to study similarities or differences between particle size distributions and/or to describe temporal and spatial variations of distributions. The function was applied to the following particle size distributions: 1. - Mass-size distribution of a sand sample 2. - Size distribution of diamonds 3. - Size distribution of river bed sediments 4. - Size distribution of glacio-fluvial sediments 5. - Measurements of aerosol distributions 6. - Particle size distributions in sprays 7. - Molecular weight distributions. A brief account of previous work is given and the major properties of the log-hyperbolic function are described. Experimental particle size distributions of sand, diamonds, river bed sediments, spray droplets, aerosols, and polymer molecules are fitted by the log-hyperbolic function and it is shown that it satisfactorily applies to all distributions. © 1986.},

This 5-yr study was initiated in 2004 to better understand N (as urea) and K (as K2SO4) effects on soil and plant response of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. 'Brightstar'). A field study was conducted to evaluate five rate levels of N (49, 147, 245, 343, or 441 kg ha-1 yr-1) with three rate levels of K (49, 245, or 441 kg ha-1 yr-1). Clipping yield (CY), leaf tissue K, soil pH, rooting (in 2004 and 2005 only), and soil K were assessed in spring of each year. Leaf K and soil K increased linearly with K applied, whereas leaf K and CY regression slopes with soil K increased with greater N applied. Leaf K and CY increased linearly with N, whereas rooting, soil pH, and soil K decreased linearly with increased N. Rooting was inversely related to CY. Luxury consumption of K was observed in the latter years of the test (2006) at N rates of 245 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and lower. The strength of the regression (r²) and covariation between CY and leaf K increased with N rate and decreased with year of the test. There were no observed changes in shoot and root growth in response to K fertilization even at low soil test K levels (50 mg kg-1). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

With similar soils, low in organic matter, dispersant had to be added to stop partial flocculation of the test suspensions. Any gypsum present in soils has to be removed to prevent flocculation. For soils very strongly aggregated by organic matter, all the {$<$} 2 μm particles present can be released only by sonic vibration in dispersant rather than water. On four soils studied in detail, the maximum amounts of {$<$} 2 μm particles obtained by sonic vibration, vigorous shaking, and the I.S.S.S. method have been compared. On three of the four soils, the values were in close agreement. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {Determination of soil particle-size distribution (PSD) by sieving, hydrometer, and pipette methods as well as by laser diffraction (LD) suffers from inherent flaws, mainly due to the difficulty in defining the size of irregularly shaped particles. Therefore these methods yield only estimates of PSD. The objective of this study was to determine whether a functional relationship exists between the PSDs obtained by the combined sieve-pipette method and those obtained by LD. Samples from 42 California soils were analyzed. For the LD measurements a Beckman-Coulter LS-230 apparatus with a 750-nm laser beam that measures particles in the range of 0.04 to 2000 μm was used, employing the Mie theory for the PSD calculations. Values of 1.5 and 0.2 for the real part and the imaginary term of the refractive index (RI), respectively, gave satisfactory results for the optical model calculations. Volume percentage of the clay-size fraction obtained by LD was generally lower than mass percentage of the clay fraction derived by the pipette method. The opposite trend was noted for the silt-size fraction. Coefficients of determination for the regression equations for the clay, silt, and sand fractions determined by the two methods were 0.702, 0.689, and 0.821, respectively. Good agreement between measured and calculated LD values for one size class was accompanied by poor agreement between measured and calculated values for the other. The LD method provides a continuous PSD curve, which enables a detailed data analysis and a flexible application of different partide-size dependent classification systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The production of axillary shoots (tillering) in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) depends on intraspecific competition. The mechanisms that underlie this competition are complex, but light within the wheat canopy plays a key role. The main objectives of this paper are to analyse the effects of plant population density and shade on tillering dynamics of spring wheat, to assess the canopy conditions quantitatively at the time of tillering cessation, and to analyse the relationship between the tiller bud and the leaf on the same phytomer. METHODS: Spring wheat plants were grown at three plant population densities and under two light regimes (25 \% and 100 \% light). Tiller appearance, fraction of the light intercepted, and red : far-red ratio at soil level were recorded. On six sampling dates the growth status of axillary buds was analysed. KEY RESULTS: Tillering ceased earlier at high population densities and ceased earlier in the shade than in full sunlight. At cessation of tillering, both the fraction of light intercepted and the red : far-red ratio at soil level were similar in all treatments. Leaves on the same phytomer of buds that grew out showed more leaf mass per unit area than those on the same phytomer of buds that remained dormant. CONCLUSIONS: Tillering ceases at specific light conditions within the wheat canopy, independent of population density, and to a lesser extent independent of light intensity. It is suggested that cessation of tillering is induced when the fraction of PAR intercepted by the canopy exceeds a specific threshold (0.40-0.45) and red : far-red ratio drops below 0.35-0.40.},

  abstract = {The standard sieving, pipette, and hydrometer methods for soil particle size analysis (PSA) have three main drawbacks: (i) the procedures are tedious, (ii) the procedures are time consuming, (iii) and the results are protocol dependent. Laser diffraction PSA delivers rapid results using standardized procedures, but so far it has been difficult to reconcile results with those from standard sedimentation methods. The objective of this study was to develop a protocol that would permit direct usage of laser diffraction PSA and render results compatible with current methods. The protocol was developed using 54 standard soil samples from different textural classes. Regression of the laser diffraction PSA against the hydrometer/pipette method yielded R2 values of 0.92/0.9, 0.92/0.94, and 0.99/0.99 and RMSE values of 0.04/0.05, 0.07/0.06 and 0.05/0.03 for clay, silt, and sand, respectively. These statistics are comparable to those obtained by regressing results of the hydrometer against the sieve and pipette methods. A key factor in securing accurate and precise results was limiting the particle size range of the samples by wet sieving the sand fraction. This created representative samples and stable soil dispersed suspensions, allowing accurate estimations of particle size distribution for clay and silt fractions without empirical transformations. Results obtained with the proposed protocol matched those of standard sedimentation analyses for a wide range of soils, encouraging further adoption of laser diffraction for soil PSA.},

It is shown that these two particular points correspond to Atterberg's plastic and liquid limits, each related to a specific level of energy.

  abstract = {Sedimentation has been a standard methodology for particle size analysis since the early 1900s. In recent years laser diffraction is beginning to replace sedimentation as the prefered technique in some industries, such as marine sediment analysis. However, for the particle size analysis of soils, which have a diverse range of both particle size and shape, laser diffraction still requires evaluation of its reliability. In this study, the sedimentation based sieve plummet balance method and the laser diffraction method were used to measure the particle size distribution of 22 soil samples representing four contrasting Australian Soil Orders. Initially, a precise wet riffling methodology was developed capable of obtaining representative samples within the recommended obscuration range for laser diffraction. It was found that repeatable results were obtained even if measurements were made at the extreme ends of the manufacturer’s recommended obscuration range. Results from statistical analysis suggested that the use of sample pretreatment to remove soil organic carbon (and possible traces of calcium-carbonate content) made minor differences to the laser diffraction particle size distributions compared to no pretreatment. These differences were found to be marginally statistically significant in the Podosol topsoil and Vertosol subsoil. There are well known reasons why sedimentation methods may be considered to ‘overestimate’ plate-like clay particles, while laser diffraction will ‘underestimate’ the proportion of clay particles. In this study we used Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient to determine the equivalence of laser diffraction and sieve plummet balance results. The results suggested that the laser diffraction equivalent thresholds corresponding to the sieve plummet balance cumulative particle sizes of {$<$} 2 μm, {$<$} 20 μm, and {$<$} 200 μm, were {$<$} 9 μm, {$<$} 26 μm, {$<$} 275 μm respectively. The many advantages of laser diffraction for soil particle size analysis, and the empirical results of this study, suggest that deployment of laser diffraction as a standard test procedure can provide reliable results, provided consistent sample preparation is used.},

  abstract = {However, all palettes are fully customizable: diverge\_hcl(7, h = c(246, 40), c = 96, l = c(65, 90)) Choosing the values would be daunting. But there are some recommended palettes in the colorspace documentation. There is also an interactive tool that can be used to obtain a customized palette. To start the tool: pal {$<$}-choose\_palette() R has 657 built in color names To see a list of names: colors() These colors are displayed on P. 3. R color cheatsheet Finding a good color scheme for presenting data can be challenging. This color cheatsheet will help! R uses hexadecimal to represent colors Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system used to describe color. Red, green, and blue are each represented by two characters (\#rrggbb). Each character has 16 possible symbols: 0, "00" can be interpreted as 0.0 and "FF" as 1.0 i.e., red= \#FF0000 , black=\#000000, white = \#FFFFFF Two additional characters (with the same scale) can be added to the end to describe transparency (\#rrggbbaa) A few notes on HSV/HLC HSV is a better model for how humans perceive color. HCL can be thought of as a perceptually based version of the HSV model….blah blah blah… Without delving into color theory: color schemes based on HSV/HLC models generally just look good. R translates various color models to hex, e.g.: • RGB (red, green, blue): The default intensity scale in R ranges from 0-1; but another commonly used scale is 0-255. This is obtained in R using maxColorValue=255. alpha is an optional argument for transparency, with the same intensity scale. rgb(r, g, b, maxColorValue=255, alpha=255) • HSV (hue, saturation, value): values range from 0-1, with optional alpha argument hsv(h, s, v, alpha) • HCL (hue, chroma, luminance): hue describes the color and ranges from 0-360; 0 = red, 120 = green, blue = 240, etc. Range of chroma and luminance depend on hue and each other hcl(h, c, l, alpha) peachpuff4 TIP: When it comes to selecting a color palette, DO NOT try to handpick individual colors! You will waste a lot of time and the result will probably not be all that great. R has some good packages for color palettes. Here are some of the options Packages: grDevices and colorRamps grDevices comes with the base installation and colorRamps must be installed. Each palette's function has an argument for the number of colors and transparency (alpha): Package: RcolorBrewer This function has an argument for the number of colors and the color palette (see P. 4 for options). brewer.pal(4, "Set3") {$>$} "\#8DD3C7" "\#FFFFB3" "\#BEBADA" "\#FB8072" For the rainbow palette you can also select start/end color (red = 0, yellow = 1/6, green = 2/6, cyan = 3/6, blue = 4/6 and magenta = 5/6) and saturation (s) and value (v): rainbow(n, s = 1, v = 1, start = 0, end = max(1, n-1)/n, alpha = 1) To view colorbrewer palettes in R: display.brewer.all(5) There is also a very nice interactive viewer: http://colorbrewer2.org/ Package: colorspace These color palettes are based on HCL and HSV color models. The results can be very aesthetically pleasing. There are some default palettes: \#\# My Recommendation \#\#},

Accordingly, numerous specimen reconstitution methods have been developed for use in the laboratory. Among these methods, moist tamping has the advantage that it is relatively easy to control the global specimen density achieved, even for loose specimens, although unfortunately the method has also been qualitatively shown to yield less uniform specimens. This paper describes the findings of a study that critically assessed the moist tamping method by measuring the forces applied during the tamping process and investigated the uniformity of specimens prepared with the method by quantitatively analyzing both X-ray and optical images.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Ralph B. Peck (1912–2008), graduate and doctor of philosophy in civil engineering (1934 and 1937 respectively) from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was one of the major contributors to the development of geotechnics in the twentieth century. Born in Winnipeg (Manitoba) as an American national, he was influenced from childhood by the world of civil engineering through his father, Orwin K. Peck, who was a civil engineer, mainly as a structural engineer in the railway sector. In the absence of job offers as a structural engineer, Ralph Peck arrived at Harvard University in 1938 to attend the soil mechanics courses taught by Arthur Casagrande, which guided Peck's professional career towards geotechnics. In addition to Casagrande, Peck had the opportunity to meet and work with other very important people related to geotechnics: Albert E. Cummings, Laurits Bjerrum, Alec W. Skempton and especially Karl Terzaghi, with whom he established a great friendship, in addition to providing support, professional advice and performing important work, such as the Chicago Subway Works. Peck actively dedicated himself to consulting work, which led him to visit 44 states within the United States and 28 countries on five continents. In addition, he also participated in research work where he was asked and was a committed lecturer at the University of Illinois, where he was a professor for 32 years. The objective of this paper is to analyse, through Peck's biography, his contribution to the field of geotechnics based on his research, teaching and consultancy work, and through the influence of Peck on other important people in the field, such as Karl Terzaghi.},

  abstract = {© 2015 British Society of Soil Science. A large number of factors that influence soil surface cracking behaviour in swell-shrink soils have been studied, but there are few studies on the influence of rock fragments on crack development. Effects of rock fragments have been investigated with reference to the soil pore system but they have mainly been studied indirectly through measurements of water flow and/or bulk density changes. A laboratory experiment was carried out with repacked soil samples that were prepared by adding rock fragments of three different sizes (2-4, 4-8 and 12-16mm) to a Vertisol at two different rates (10 and 25\% by volume). Soil image analysis procedures were applied in order to describe quantitatively the network of surface cracks and the pore system to a depth of 8cm below the surface, which developed after wetting-drying cycles. Mean values and standard deviations of surface crack or pore widths decreased with the increase in rock fragment content and the decrease in rock fragment size, while the density of the 'skeleton' of the crack and pore networks increased. Rock fragments also induced vertical homogenization of the soil structure. The number of rock fragments was a key factor in determining some crack network characteristics, inducing inverse variations in mean width and skeleton density of the crack or pore network. Overall results suggested that rock fragments acted as triggering points for crack and pore development in Vertisols. The findings of this work provide a contribution to the understanding of the mechanisms of crack network and soil structure development that are induced by stones in swell-shrink soils.},

The simplified method requires no calibration, graphs or tables and uses a weighted average of the 1.5-hour and 24-hour readings to determine the 2µm clay fraction. The relationship is: where P2µm = summation percentage for the 2µm clay fraction. P24, P1.5 = summation percentage for settling time of 24 hour and 1.5 hour, respectively. K = weighting factor, used to approximate the actual relation of the summation percentage curve over the clay percentage range of interest. This equation was found to be satisfactory in the range of 5\% ⩽ P2µm ⩽60\% by weight for over 70 North Dakota soil and subsoil materials when K=0.876. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the Day, Bouyoucos, and the Simplified Day hydrometer methods to determine which of several measured parameters contribute to the greatest possible error; hence which parameters should be controlled with the greatest precision. The hydrometer scale reading error contributes more error than any other single parameter.},

Previous research developed an index known as the dark green color index (DGCI) via DIA as an indicator of turf color. The objective of this study was to use DGCI variability to better predict a visual rating (VR) index used to evaluate tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) color under different irrigation treatments. To develop DGCI statistics, two freeware software packages (ImageJ and R) were used to extract and process information from digital images. The model to predict VR from DIA was developed and calibrated using candidate DGCI statistical moments from 120 images in a calibration data set using a multiple linear regression procedure. Fitness of calibration and validation models were verified using the adjusted coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and the Mallow's C p statistic. The two-variable model produced more precise estimates (adjusted R2 = 0.926 and 0.899) than the model that only used one term in predicting the VR values (adjusted R2 = 0.879 and 0.843) for calibration and validation sets, respectively. These data suggest incorporating a measure of color uniformity improves the use of DGCI in predicting VR values compared to using only the mean of DGCI values to predict VR values. Model refinements may be needed for other turf species, but current work suggests using additional statistical moments such as SD improves VR estimate precision and accuracy. © Crop Science Society of America.},

  abstract = {Tilled agricultural soils are in a constant state of change induced by variations in soil strength due to wetting and drying and compaction by farm implements. Changes in soil structure affect many hydraulic and transport properties; hence their quantification is critical for accu- rate hydrological and environmental modeling. This study highlights the role of soil rheology in determining time-dependent stress–strain relationships that are essential for prediction and analysis of structural changes in soils. The primary objectives of this study were (i) to extend a previously proposed aggregate-pair model to prediction of compaction under external steady or transient stresses and (ii) to provide experimentally determined rheological information for the above models. Rheological properties of soils and clay minerals were measured with a rotational rheometer with parallel-plate sensors. These measurements, under controlled steady shear stress application, have shown that wet soils have viscoplastic behavior with well-defined yield stress and nearly constant plastic viscosity. In contrast, rapid transient loading (e.g., passage of a tractor) is often too short for complete viscous dissipation of applied stress, resulting in an elastic (recoverable) component of deformation (viscoelastic behavior). Measured viscoelastic properties were expressed by complex viscosity and shear modulus whose components denote viscous energy dissipa- tion, and energy storage (elastic). Results show that for low water contents and fast loading (tractor speed), the elastic component of deformation increases, whereas with higher water contents, viscosity and shear modulus decrease. Steady and oscillatory stress application to an aggregate pair model illustrates potential use of rheological properties towards obtaining predictions of strains in soil},

The first four instruments use laser diffraction. The Sedigraph and Atterberg cylinder are based on sedimentation. The Coulter Multisizer 3 uses impedance measurements and the last three instruments use optical techniques. Grain-size analyses were carried out on four sediments with median grain diameters of approximately 35, 30, 12 and 9 μm, respectively, and with no particles {$>$}90 μm. The laser diffraction instruments produced the best results for the various criteria considered in this study, followed by the Coulter Multisizer 3 (electrical sensing zone technique), the sedimentation techniques and the optical methods. However, the study also showed that there is no such thing as an 'ideal' method because techniques may score differently according to the criterion tested. An appropriate evaluation thus requires that various criteria be considered. Issues to be taken into account are: type of sediment, quantity of sediment available, speed of measurement, complexity of the measurement protocol, processing of the data, reproducibility of the results and the specific aims of the study undertaken. © 2007 The Author.

This utilises a macro file (jPOR.txt) for ImageJ, which can be used on digital photomicrographs of thin sections. The method requires no specialised scientific equipment and can be run entirely using free to download software. Digital images are acquired from blue resin-impregnated thin sections using a conventional film scanner in the present study, though the technique can be applied to any high resolution colour digital acquired by different means (e.g., flat bed scanning, digital capture). Images are preprocessed using a newly developed custom 8-bit palette and analysed for porosity in ImageJ using the simple to use jPOR macro. Our method rapidly calculates TOP for batches of images with or without the option of user adjustment. Results are compared with conventional methods (e.g., to point counting), and tested with several users to estimate any user variability. jPOR provided comparable results to more time-consuming point counting, but with significantly less "counting error" and less interoperator variability than published point counting studies. The jPOR macro has been integrated into a macro tool set that can be configured to be run on ImageJ start up. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We previously analyzed five ELNs and performed two survey-based studies to implement an ELN in a biomedical research institute. Among the ELNs tested, we found that Microsoft OneNote presents numerous features related to ELN best functionalities. In addition, both surveyed groups preferred OneNote over a scientifically designed ELN (PerkinElmer Elements). However, OneNote remains a general note-taking application and has not been designed for scientific purposes. We therefore provide a quick guide to adapt OneNote to an ELN workflow that can also be adjusted to other nonscientific ELNs.},

  abstract = {The modulus and damping properties of soils in compression are a function of soil type, water content, stress history and loading rate. To model human-surface interaction with natural turf sports surfaces, stiffness and damping properties must be determined at dynamic loading rates. Two contrasting soil types, a Sand and a Clay Loam, commonly used in sports surfaces were loaded uniaxially to 2 kN at loading rates between 0.6 and 6 kN s-1 in modified dynamic soil testing apparatus. Soils were compacted prior to loading but initial cycles resulted in viscoplastic deformation, with strain accumulation with repeated cycles of loading. Ultimately a resilient, viscoelastic steady-state equilibrium with loading was established. Resilient modulus and damping ratio varied with soil type, water content, stress history and increased significantly with loading rate. The resilient modulus of the Sand soil, typical of modern free-draining sand construction natural turf sports surfaces, was significantly greater than that of a Clay Loam soil more characteristic of traditional natural turf surfaces; reducing water content caused an increase in modulus and a decrease in damping ratio in the Clay Loam soil. Determination of these properties provides initial data for the modelling natural turf surface behaviour in terms of both ball and human interactions, with further research required to determine the effect of both grass roots and leaves on mechanical behaviour.

This paper presents a new sample preparation method, in which the sedimentation method and consolidation test are combined, to prepare the saturated specimens for fall cone test for determining the consistency limits, and the sample prepared by this new method can be considered completely saturated. For the specimens prepared by the previous sample preparation method, the decrease in the water content leads to a decrease in the degree of saturation of soil. The test results show that the specimens prepared by this new method can reach a low water content, and the minimum penetration depths are as low as 2\,mm, and the plastic limit could be obtained directly. In addition, the van shear test results show that the unsaturated specimens have larger values of undrained shear strength than the saturated specimens at the same water content, which could explain the difference of consistency limits obtained from different specimen preparation methods.},

The thread-rolling test was standardised at the US Public Roads Bureau in the 1920s and 1930s, and has subsequently become one of the standard tests of soil mechanics. This paper reviews the original definitions of plastic limit as proposed by Atterberg, and proposes that the brittle failure observed in the plastic limit test is caused by either air entry or cavitation in the clay. Critical state soil mechanics is used to show that the observed range of undrained shear strengths of soils at plastic limit is consistent with this hypothesis. The fallacy that strength at plastic limit is a constant is highlighted, and the implications for geotechnical practice are discussed.},

The percussion test for liquid limit originally described by Casagrande [Casagrande, A., 1932, "Research on the Atterberg Limits of Soils," Public Roads, Vol. 13, pp. 121136] is the standard test for liquid limit in much of the world. The apparatus to be used is described in many design codes including ASTM D4318-10e1 [Standard Test Methods for Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index of Soils, Annual Book of ASTM Standards, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA]. While it is well known that two classes of these devices exist, those with hard and soft bases, the true picture is more complex; international design codes contain a great variety of specifications for the devices, some much more prescriptive than others. This paper uses the analysis described by Haigh (2012) to investigate the effects of base hardness and resilience on specific strength at liquid limit. A survey of devices in use worldwide was also carried out, indicating that both the variability in national design standards and potential degradation of bases over time leads to a large variability in the specific strength observed at liquid limit when different devices are used. The paper demonstrates that both base hardness and resilience must be regularly monitored in order to achieve consistency of liquid limit test results and that international standards should be more closely aligned if measured values are to be used within regressions based on liquid limit tests carried out with apparatus based on a different standard.},

  abstract = {Soil mineralogy is determined routinely because of its strong infl uence on soil behavior, its use in soil classification, and its relevance to soil genetic processes. Soils commonly contain primary minerals, which are formed from magma and provide insight into charac-teristics such as parent material provenance, uniformity, and weathering rates. Soils also contain secondary minerals, which are formed from weathering processes, and may have crystallographic characteristics that strongly infl uence the physical and chemical proper-ties of soils. For example, some phyllosilicates are termed expansible because they adsorb water and cations on interior surfaces within the crystal structure itself. Expansion of the interior surfaces, or interlayers, imparts high cation exchange capacity (CEC) relative to nonexpansible phyllosilicates and most other secondary minerals. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the technique most heavily relied on in soil mineralogical analysis. X-ray diffraction is a technique that provides detailed information about the atomic structure of crystalline substances. It is a powerful tool in the identifi cation of minerals in rocks and soils. The bulk of the clay fraction of many soils is crystalline, but clay particles are too small for optical crystallographic methods to be applied. Therefore, XRD has long been a mainstay in the identifi cation of clay-sized minerals in soils. However, its useful-ness extends to coarser soil fractions as well. X-ray diffraction analysis can be conducted on single crystals or powders. This chapter will be devoted to X-ray powder diffraction (Reynolds, 1989a), since that is the technique most applicable to soil mineralogy. The objective of this chapter is to provide a detailed procedural reference for soil mineralogical determination by XRD. This chapter will emphasize well-established tech-niques, as well as some of the more recent innovative procedures. Alternative approaches will be cited to the extent possible, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We are indebted to preceding works addressing XRD methodologies applicable to soils (Jackson, 1956; Brown and Brindley, 1980; Whittig and Allardice, 1986). Some familiarity of principles underlying XRD analysis is advisable before under-taking the procedures and interpretations. Many sources are available that address these principles in detail (e.g., Klug and Alexander, 1974; Cullity, 1978). Other useful sources of information about XRD theory and interpretation applied specifi cally to powder methods include Bish and Post (1989), Zevin and Kimmel (1995), and Moore and Reynolds (1997). The following section provides a brief introduction to some fundamental aspects of XRD.},

  abstract = {Digital soil morphometrics is defined as the application of instruments and techniques for measuring and mapping soil profile properties and deriving continuous depth functions. Here, we discuss some of the main results that were presented at the “Inaugural Global Workshop on Digital Soil Morphometrics” that was held in June 2015. We focus on instruments and techniques that have been used to measure soil properties in the field as well as in the laboratory, on modelling of soil depth functions, on the mapping of the soil profile (soil profile imaging) and on the use and applications of digital soil morphometrics. There have been consider- able advancements in sampling and analysing soil profile properties in the field. Some instruments are restricted to dry soil, whereas others are affected by ambient light conditions. The mapping of the soil profile has yielded several methods to derive soil horizons and can deal with the variation within soil horizons. There are a certain number of soil depth functions that can be used for most soil properties and soil types. The use and application of digital soil morphometrics is mostly confined to enhanced pedological insight including soil classification, but with time, we envision that it can transform the way we observe, analyse and understand soils.},

  abstract = {The soil is defined differently by soil scientists, and its definition has changed over time. This paper reviews how the definition of the soil has changed since the early 1800s by selecting and listing 81 definitions given in a wide range of soil science books, handbooks, glossaries, and dictionaries. Initial definitions of the soil were based on developments in agricultural chemistry or geology. The soil was seen as a production factor (medium) for agriculture that needed to be understood before it could be improved, or the soil was defined as disintegrated rocks mixed with organic matter. Definitions were rudimentary reflecting the overall level of understanding. Soil variation was not well understood. Overarching soil definitions appeared in the late 1800s following some major shifts in the understanding and knowledge about soils. The definition of the soil was particularly relevant for soil survey and in soil classification because it affected how soils were viewed in the field and represented in a two dimensional way (soil maps). Both the World Reference Base (WRB) and Soil Taxonomy have defined the soil, but standard field books describing soils often lack a definition. Most of the definitions in dictionaries and glossaries are detailed stressing the organic and inorganic part of the soil as well the origin, complexity, and some of its functions. Current soil definitions have a more environmental outlook reflecting the broadening of the soil science discipline but definitions will change following scientific advances and discovery. Soils are defined differently by subdisciplines. Considerable research is conducted nowadays outside soil science departments and research centres, and for some researchers the soil may solely be a medium-just as it was in the mid-1800s. The effect of increased specialisation and expansion in soil science causes the detail of the investigation to prevail over the idea of soil as a complex dynamic system that is part of a much wider Earth system. This review ends with a proposal for a scientific definition of soil, and a definition for lay persons and the general public. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Soil–tool interaction poses an ongoing challenge to researchers, developers, and manufacturers. Numerous studies have focused on reaction forces, resistances, and associated soil failures during the penetration of tillage tools into soil or their surface movements. However, little research has been devoted to the interactions involved in the torsion failure of soil in agricultural tillage systems. To study the resistance of soil to failure due to torsion actions, this study develops a torsion-induced soil failure estimation model that is used to obtain relevant parameters based on in-situ experiments conducted in a soil bin by using soil with different physical properties (i.e., moisture content and soil density). Four vanes with various diameters but the same height (5 cm) were designed. The maximum torques at which soil failure occurred were then measured and analyzed. The results revealed a power function relationship between the soil failure due to torsion and the diameter of the vane, i.e., T = αDβ (R2 {$>$} 0.96). The dimensionless parameters α and β of the estimation model were found to be related to the soil moisture (P {$<$} 0.05) and bulk density (P {$<$} 0.05), respectively. The values of both α and β varied nonlinearly with the soil moisture content, cone index, and bulk density. It was concluded that the power function can be applied to describe the relationship between the torque and the diameter of the vane; with the measurement device performing a torsion action in the soil layer, the torque at which soil failure occurs can be estimated by using the diameter of the vane along with the moisture content of the soil and its bulk density. When the height of the vane was constant, the torsion could be predicted by using the proposed power function model at certain soil conditions.},

  abstract = {The particle-size curve (PSC) defines the continuous size distribution of mineral particles {$<$}2 mm. It is used for soil classification and to derive func- tional soil parameters such as the soil–water characteristic (SWC) curve, soil hydraulic properties, and gas transport properties. Conventional methods for measuring texture are time-consuming and most methods only provide discrete particle-size intervals. The Rosin–Rammler and Fredlund functions enable a continuous description of the size distribution of mineral particles using two and three fitting parameters, respectively. Visible near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) is a time-saving and well-known alternative soil analysis method. In this study vis-NIRS was used to indirectly obtain PSCs by predicting the fitting parameters of the Rosin–Rammler (aR, bR) and Fredlund (aF, nF, and mF) functions. A total of 431 soil samples from 7 agricultural fields in Denmark and Greenland were analyzed for soil texture (clay: 0.028–0.426 kg kg-1) and organic matter (OM) content (0.018– 0.143 kg kg-1). The Rosin–Rammler and Fredlund functions were fitted to the PSCs. Soil diffuse reflectance was measured from 400 to 2500 nm with a spectrometer. The important spectral regions for correlating aR, bR, aF, nF, mF, and OM to spectra were selected using forward interval partial least squares (iPLS) regression on a calibration set. The soil spectra showed high correlation to PSC function parameters and OM content for the validation set. Further, vis-NIRS cross-validation models for the fitting parameters of the Rosin–Rammler and Fredlund functions were built on all samples and used as input for the PSCs, generating RMSE values of 4.2 and 3.5\%, respective- ly. Both PSC functions convincingly covered the PSC variation within fields, although the Fredlund function performed slightly better. From one vis-NIRS scanning the complete texture comprising the PSC and the OM content was successfully characterized},

This field study compared the effects of field burning and mechanical removal of post- harvest residue on Kentucky bluegrass plant growth and seed yields. 'Merion', 'Nugget', 'Baron', 'Glade', and 'South Dakota' Kentucky blue- grass cultivars were seeded on a Latahco soil, (fine-silty, mixed, frigid argiaquic Agrialboll) in 1976. Residue removal treatments were stripped across the cultivars in 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. Seed yields where residue was removed by burning were 1.5 times greater in 1979,1.6 times greater in 1980, and 1.7 times greater in 1981 than yields where residue was mechanically removed to 2.5 cm. Seed yields where residue was removed by burning were 2.0 times greater in 1979, 1.9 times greater in 1980, and 2.6 times greater in 1981 than yields from plants where residue was mechanically removed to 7.6 cm. Panicle and tiller numbers were reduced where residue was mechanically removed to 2.5 or 7.6 cm compared to panicle and tiller numbers where residue was burned. Tiller leaf sheath lengths were not different where residue was burned or removed to 2.5 cm and were shorter than where residue was removed to 7.6 cm. Rhizome weights were reduced where residue was burned compared to weights where residue was clipped at 2.5 or 7.6 cm height in both 1980 and 1981. Root weights, when averaged across all five cultivars, were not affected by residue removal method. A significant cultivar X treatment interaction was noted for Glade, which produced more roots when clipped to 2.5 cm than when burned or clipped to 7.6 cm in both years. Significant cultivar X treatment interactions occurred in 1980 in tiller number which were reflected in panicle numbers and seed yields for Glade and South Dakota. Increased tiller production was associated with decreased rhizome weights. Since tiller apices have been found to control the upturning of rhizomes to produce new tillers, it was concluded that burning functions to reduce tiller apical control of rhizomes. The increased length of tiller leaf sheaths under decreasing heights of residue removal was concluded to be in response to decreased light penetration into the canopy.},

The author believes that the clays here discussed were mostly deposited in swamps and owe their purity to the leaching action of waters containing carbonic and organic acids, which leached out the iron, alkalis, etc. Such leaching would occur chiefly in those portions of the swamp where the water was circulating along channels. Differential leaching would therefore explain variable composition in the underclays. Copyright © 1927, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Four different sand shapes, i.e., round, sub-round, sub-angular and angular, were tested at two different moisture levels, air-dried and –30 cm. For all sands, an increase in bulk modulus was observed with increasing isotropic pressure. The dry round sand without peat had the highest bulk modulus value of 27.5 MPa at 352 kPa mean pressure; whereas, the dry subangular sand without peat had the highest failure strength value of 193 kPa at 38 kPa confining pressure. In general, moisture increased compressibility of sands and decreased failure strength and shear modulus values. Peat had a dominant influence on the mechanical response i.e., the hydrostatic compression for all four sand shapes with peat had similar compression profiles. When peat and moisture were added to the sands, the mixture became most compressible and easiest to fail among all treatments. In addition, the changes of mechanical properties were noticeable.},

Structural grade lightweight aggregates, when used in backfills and over soft soils, provide geotechnical physical properties that include reduced density, high stability, high permeability, and high thermal resistance. These improved physical properties result from aggregates with a reduced specific gravity and a predictable stability that results from a consistently high angle of internal friction. The open texture available from a closely controlled manufactured aggregate gradation ensures high permeability. High thermal resistance results from porosity developed during the production process. Physical properties of structural grade lightweight aggregate and geotechnical engineering properties of lightweight aggregate backfills are illustrated, along with references to extensive testing programs that developed data on shear strength, compressibility, durability, and in-place density. Representative case studies are reported from the almost 100 projects that illustrate completed applications of structural grade lightweight aggregate fills over soft soils and behind retaining walls and bridge abutments.},

Compaction is evaluated for total clay soil contents of 10, 15, and 20\%. Different trends in optimum water content, wopt, and maximum dry unit weight, γdmax, versus clay soil content among the S-AC, S-GB, and S-PB mixtures are attributed, in part, to (1) the greater water sorptivity and lower swelling potential of attapulgite clay relative to the bentonites, (2) the larger particle sizes of the granular bentonite in the air-dried condition relative to the powdery bentonite, and (3) the possible correlation between the wopt and the plasticity index of the sand-bentonite mixtures. The Δwopt values and Δγdmaxvalues resulting from one-day versus seven-day curing periods before compaction of the S-GB and S-PB mixtures are ∼0.5 percentage points and ≤0.08 kN/m3 (≤0.5 pcf), respectively, and result in different trends in γdmax versus bentonite content for the two types of sand-bentonite mixtures. Also, mixing the sand and bentonite in a dry condition before adding water consistently results in greater wopt and γdmax values than mixing the sand with the appropriate amount of water before adding the bentonite regardless of the type of bentonite. Finally, mixing the attapulgite clay and granular bentonite together in small amounts for each individual compaction point for the S-AC-GB mixtures consistently results in higher γdmax and wopt values relative to mixing the attapulgite clay and granular bentonite together in large amounts sufficient to cover all compaction points.},

  abstract = {The literature contains some hypotheses regarding the most favorable ground reaction force (GRF) for sprint running and how it might be achieved. This study tested the relevance of these hypotheses to the acceleration phase of a sprint, using GRF impulse as the GRF variable of interest. Thirty-six athletes performed maximal-effort sprints from which video and GRF data were collected at the 16-m mark. Associations between GRF impulse (expressed relative to body mass) and various kinematic measures were explored with simple and multiple linear regressions and paired t-tests. The regression results showed that relative propulsive impulse accounted for 57\% of variance in sprint velocity. Relative braking impulse accounted for only 7\% of variance in sprint velocity. In addition, the faster athletes tended to produce only moderate magnitudes of relative vertical impulse. Paired t-tests revealed that lower magnitudes of relative braking impulse were associated with a smaller touchdown distance (p {$<$} 0.01) and a more active touchdown (p {$<$} 0.001). Also, greater magnitudes of relative propulsive impulse were associated with a high mean hip extension velocity of the stance limb (p {$<$} 0.05). In conclusion, it is likely that high magnitudes of propulsion are required to achieve high acceleration. Although there was a weak trend for faster athletes to produce lower magnitudes of braking, the possibility of braking having some advantages could not be ruled out. Further research is required to see if braking, propulsive, and vertical impulses can be modified with specific training. This will also provide insight into how a change in one GRF component might affect the others.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of seven models (i.e., five lognormal models, the Gompertz model, and the Fredlund model) to fit PSD data sets from a wide range of soil textures. Special attention was given to the effect of texture on model performance. Several criteria were used to determine the optimum model with the least number of fitting parameters when other conditions are equal. The Fredlund model with four parameters showed the best performance with the majority of soils studied, even when three criteria that impose a penalty for additional fitting parameters were used. Especially, the relative performance of the Fredlund model in regard to other models increased with increase of clay content. Among all soil classes, the lognormal models with two or three parameters showed better fits for silty clay, silty clay loam, and silt loam soils, and worse fit for sandy clay loam soil.},

The modified precedure differs in that a single vessel called a Fleaker is used to disperse and pipette the sample prior to the removal of sandys by wet sieving, making the transfer to a soil-sedimentation cylinder unnecessary. Fleakers cost less than cylinders, allow for quicker sample preparation, and permit more samples to be analyzed at one time in less space. -from Authors},

A programme of research has been undertaken to identify the factors that lead to the construction of high quality cricket pitches. This work employed the technology of highspeed video analysis to monitor the performance of first class cricket pitches during county matches. A system for measuring the impact of a cricket ball on a pitch was developed, and over 3000 ball impacts analysed. This analysis enabled pitches to be characterized in terms of pace, bounce and consistency. Soil properties for the monitored pitches were identified and correlations were drawn between pitch performance and soil composition.},

Carriage consists of a chassis and a tool frame, and its travel speed is variable within 20 km/h. The carriage has a capacity of testing three prototypes of tools in each run. The tool frame of the carriage is reversible that allows the carriage to simulate uphill and downhill tillage operations. Also, the tool frame can be controlled to simulate tillage operations on curvatures. It can be used to study the kinematics of soil-engaging tools, assess the erodibility of landscape and the erosivity of tillage etc.},

Physiological responses of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) treated with or without Macro-Sorb Foliar (FOLIAR) and subjected to optimal growing conditions or high air temperature stress (20, 28, and 36 degrees C) were investigated in vivo using three separate growth chamber experiments. Turfgrass photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm ratio), leaf membrane thermostability, and leaf antioxidant (polyphenol) concentration were measured. Perennial ryegrass treated with 0.64 mL m(-2) FOLIAR and exposed to prolonged high air temperature stress (36 degrees C) exhibited 95\% better mean photochemical efficiency and 65\% better membrane thermostability than control plants. Leaf polyphenol concentrations were largely unaffected by individual treatments or temperature. No treatment differences were detected for plants maintained in the optimal temperature regime (20 degrees C), and only photochemical efficiency treatment difference were found for plants maintained at 28 degrees C. The results show that exogenous and sequential applications of FOLIAR improved perennial ryegrass metabolic responses in a highly controlled growth chamber environment. It remains difficult to extrapolate data obtained from growth chamber experiments to the field; therefore, caution must be taken when making turfgrass management recommendations.},

Next a detailed review of 67 peer-reviewed papers from 2000 to 2007 is offered presenting the benefits and challenges associated with the use of an ARS. Key benefits for using ARSs include improvements to the classroom environment (increases in attendance, attention levels, participation and engagement), learning (interaction, discussion, contingent teaching, quality of learning, learning performance), and assessment (feedback, formative, normative). The biggest challenges for teachers in using ARSs are time needed to learn and set up the ARS technology, creating effective ARS questions, adequate coverage of course material, and ability to respond to instantaneous student feedback. Student challenges include adjusting to a new method of learning, increased confusion when multiple perspectives are discussed, and negative reactions to being monitored. It is concluded that more systematic, detailed research is needed in a broader range of contexts. Crown Copyright © 2009.},

Because consistency limits are characteristic to fine-grained soils, and the material passing through \#40 mesh may include a significant amount of sand, the use of a \#40 sieve for this purpose may lead to significant errors regarding the class or plasticity level of a soil. The scope of this investigation is to compare the consistency limits obtained using the -\#40 material versus -\#200 material. Sixty soil samples were employed for the investigation. Each sample was split into two parts and sieved through \#40 and \#200 meshes. Different versions of the liquid, plastic and shrinkage limit tests were applied on each pair of soil samples. As expected, the liquid and plastic limits obtained using -\#200 material were found to be somewhat higher than those obtained using the -\#40 material. Increases in the liquid and plastic limits of -\#200 materials with respect to those of -\#40 material resulted in dramatic changes in both the class and the plasticity level of a soil. One third of the soils tested displayed features that ask us to reconsider the proper mesh size for testing consistency limits. © 2011 ejge.},

  abstract = {Particle-size analysis (PSA) is widely used in both soil science and engineering. Soil classification schemes are built on PSA values and recent developments in pedotransfer functions rely on PSA to estimate soil hydraulic properties. Because PSA is method dependent, the standardization of experimental procedures is important for the comparison of reported results. A study was conducted to compare the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) hydrometer method (D422) for PSA with the hydrometer method published by the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA). Tests on soils ranging in texture from sand to sandy clay loam were conducted at temperatures ranging from 20 to 30\{degrees\}C. The main difference between methods is the temperature correction, with the ASTM method relying on an empirical correction and the SSSA method using a blank hydrometer reading. Identical texture estimates for all but one of 48 total samples was observed between methods. Percentage of fines, silt, and clay demonstrated relatively consistent values between methods. The ASTM and SSSA methods were compared at values of D50, D30, and D10 (i.e., effective particle diameter values when the size-distributions have dropped to percentages of less than 50, 30, and 10, respectively). Excellent agreement was found between methods for D50 and D30 values (correlations above 0.99). Less agreement was found for D10 (correlation 0.989) values, but still reasonably good. The results suggest that for the range of soil textures evaluated in this study, ASTM and SSSA methods can be used interchangeably for textural analysis.},

A transportable device was built to quantify these interactions through three tests that reflect generic classes of tasks: 1) translation test; 2) rotation test; and 3) translation/drop test. All the three tests were performed using the cleated portion of a molded American football shoe on two types of natural grass surfaces. To assess repeatability of tests, we performed multiple trials of each test under the same testing conditions. To assess sensitivity of the device, the type of playing surface, temperature, and moisture level were varied. The variation among the results of repeated trials of a given set of testing conditions was less than that between the results of a given test under differing testing conditions, so the device and method were deemed to have acceptable levels of repeatability and sensitivity in the set of conditions considered.},

Variation in peak forces and torques was observed across cleats when tested on natural grass (2.8-4.2 kN in translation, 120-174 Nm in rotation). A significant (p {$<$} 0.05) relationship was found between the peak force and torque on natural grass. Almost all of the cleats caused shear failure of the natural surface, which generated a divot following a test. This is a force-limiting cleat release mode. In contrast, all but one of the cleat types held fast in the artificial turf, resulting in force and torque limited by the prescribed input load from the test device (nom. 4.8 kN and 200 Nm). Only one cleat pattern, consisting of small deformable nubs, released on the artificial surface and generated force (3.9 kN) comparable to the range observed with natural grass. These findings (1) should inform the design of cleats intended for use on natural and artificial surfaces and (2) suggest a mechanical explanation for a higher lower-limb injury rate in elite athletes playing on artificial surfaces.},

Loading conditions were applied with a custom-built testing apparatus designed to represent play-relevant maneuvers of elite athletes. Two natural grass and six infill artificial surfaces were tested with the cleated portion of a shoe intended for use on either surface type. In translation tests with a 2.~8-kN vertical load, the grass surfaces limited the horizontal force on the cleats by tearing. This tearing was not observed with the artificial surfaces, which allowed less motion and generated greater horizontal force (3.2~kN vs. 4.5~kN, p~{$<~$}0.05). Similarly, rotation tests generated less angular displacement and greater torque on the artificial surfaces (145~N~m vs. 197~N~m, p~{$<~$}0.05). Translation/drop tests, in which the foot-form was launched into the surfaces with both horizontal and vertical velocity components generated less peak horizontal force on the natural surfaces than on the artificial surfaces (2.4~kN vs. 3.0~kN, p~{$<~$}0.05). These results suggest a force-limiting mechanism inherent to natural grass surfaces. Future work should consider implications of these findings for performance and injury risk and should evaluate the findings' sensitivity to cleat pattern and playing conditions.},

  abstract = {Most earthwork construction specifications recommend a lift thickness of 0.2 m for subgrade soils during road construction. These limits were originally implemented to ensure uniform compaction across the entire depth of the soil lifts. However, it has also been argued that the larger footprints and weight available in modern compaction equipment could potentially compact thicker layers without sacrificing the mechanical performance of subbases. This paper describes a field study on the effects of the lift thickness and compactors on the quality of compacted subbases. The effectiveness of two compactors was evaluated on coarse-grained soils. Different types of geotechnical instruments were used to determine variations in the mechanical properties of soils under applied compaction energy. The main goal was to combine the information of different testing types to determine whether it is possible to use a thicker lift of coarse-grained subgrade soils during compaction. The field test results show that compaction energy propagates up to the 0.3-m depth into the soil lift. Therefore, the conventional 0.2-m lift thickness specification for road construction may be updated to potentially save construction costs without compromising mechanical performance.},

  abstract = {The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is part of the knee joint injured during taekwondo kicking. However, few studies have investigated the ACL injury mechanism and its inherent risk factors. In this study, we compared the knee joint kinematics in the pivoting leg during eight typical taekwondo kicks (back, roundhouse, turning-back, hook, side, push, axe, and front kicks) to investigate the possible risk of ACL injury. Standard inverse dynamics analyses were used to calculate axial tibial rotation and knee joint varus-valgus moment using a musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity and a motion analysis system with six high-speed digital cameras and a force plate. The maximum values of internal tibial rotation and valgus moment in the pivot leg were investigated. In addition, the time interval when the internal rotation and/or valgus moment exceeded the upper limit of the safe region during the kicking was analyzed. The results revealed that most kicks had time intervals of excessive amounts of internal tibial rotation and/or knee valgus moment, which are related to the risk of ACL injury. Moreover, one particular kicking motion, the hook kick, has a relatively high ACL injury risk in the pivot leg compared to other kicking motions. We suggest that athletes and coaches be aware of these risky kicks.},

  abstract = {Classically, the grain size of soil and sediment samples is determined by the sieve method for the coarse fractions and by the pipette method, based on the 'Stokes' sedimentation rates, for the fine fractions. Results from the two methods are compared with results from laser diffraction size analysis, which is based on the forward scattering of monochromatic coherent light. From a point of view of laboratory efficiency, the laser sizing technique is far superior. Accuracy and reproducibility are shown by measurements on certified materials. It appears that laser grain size measurements of certified materials correspond very well with the certificated measurements. Tests were also done on a set of randomly selected sediments of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine origin. Except for the ({$<$}2 ?m) clay fraction, there is a coarsening of the mean diameter of one to two size classes (0-25 ?), caused by the non-sphericity of the particles. The platy form of the clay particles induces considerable differences (eight size classes) between pipette and laser measurements: the {$<$}2 ?m grain size, defined by the pipette method corresponds with a grain size of 8 ?m defined by the Laser Particle Sizer for the studied sediments. Using a higher grain size level for the clay fraction, when laser analysis is applied, enables workers in the geological and environmental field to compare classical pipette analysis with a laser sizing technique.},

According to the BCSR concept, maximum plant growth will be achieved only when the soil's exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K concentrations are approximately 65\% Ca, 10\% Mg, and 5\% K (termed the ideal soil). This "ideai soil" was originally proposed by Firman Bear and coworkers in New Jersey during the 1940s as a method of reducing luxury K uptake by alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). At about the same time, William Albrecht, working in Missouri, conduded through his own investigations that plants require a soil witha high Ca saturation for optimal growth. While it now appears that several ofAlbrecht's experiments were fundamentally flawed, the BCSR ("balanced soil") concept has been widely promoted, suggesting that the prescribed cationic ratios provide optimum chemical, physical, and biological soil properties. Our examination of data from numerous studies (particularly those of Albrecht and Bear themselves) would suggest that, within the ranges commonly found in soils, the chemical, physical, and biological fertility of a soil is generally not influenced by the ratios of Ca, Mg, and K. The data do not support the claims of the BCSR, and continued promotion of the BCSR will result in the inefficient use of resources in agriculture and horticulture.

  abstract = {A number of reports have proposed that recently developed laser diffraction instruments show potential for automating the measurement of particle size distributions (texture) in soil and related materials, but relationships to standard sieve-sedimentation measurements have been poor and inconsistent. Measurements with a commercially available laser diffraction instrument (Horiba LA-920) on five soils having a wide range of textures (silty clay to sand) showed wide variability for proportions of clay, silt and sand when the weight of the sample was varied resulting in unacceptable consistency and conformity with hydrometer measurements. Detailed measurements were subsequently made on systematic combinations of four known silt size fractions (0-5, 38-45, 75-90 and 125-150μm diameter), to explore the reasons for the variable results. Samples weighing less than 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20g of the 38-45, 75-90 and 125-150μm diameter fractions, respectively, were not detected by the instrument. Calculations of the probable numbers of particles in these samples ranged from 0.06×106 to 1.0×106. There were, however, 2445×106 particle in a 0.05g of 0-5μm diameter sample, and was detected by the instrument. This showed that there is a threshold of the number of particles required for detection. Alternatively, similar and greater weights of small diameter particles result in potential saturation of the detector. Saturation occurred when laser light transmission was low ({$<$}20\%). Even before saturation of the detector, an interaction was detected when combinations of small and large particles were mixed such that the proportion of small particles tended to be over-estimated and large particles under-estimated. Percentage laser light transmission measurements were inadequate to guide development of calibrations to correct for threshold/saturation limits and light competition problems. It was concluded that the geometric change in numbers of particles as the size decreases in a given weight of sample is too large to allow the use of current laser diffraction instrumentation for particle analyses of soil and related samples where the sizes in the distribution are from clay to sand or even with a narrower range of sizes (e.g., clay or silt). © 2012.},

  abstract = {Trinexapac-ethyl (TE) is a widely used growth regulator in the turfgrass industry. Poor summer efficacy has been related to more rapid metabolism in the plant. The purpose of this study was to determine if a growing degree day (GDD) model could be used to identify the optimum TE reapplication interval for putting greens. This objective was accomplished through model development and validation. Model development was conducted on a creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolon-ifera L.) golf putting green in Madison, WI, during 2008. The treatments consisted of five TE reapplication intervals (100, 200, 400, 800 GDD, and 4 wk) and a control. Growing degree days were calculated in degrees C with a base temperature of 0°C. Trinexapac-ethyl was applied at the rate of 0.05 kg a.i. ha -1. Clippings were collected daily. The 100- and 200-GDD reapplication intervals provided consistent 20 and 12\% yield suppression, respectively. Other reapplication intervals had alternating periods of yield reduction followed by yield enhancement. Model validation occurred on a different creeping bentgrass green in 2009 and 2010. The experiment was a 3 × 2 factorial CRD with three TE rates (0.00, 0.05, and 0.10 kg a.i. ha-1) and two reapplication frequencies (200 GDD and 4 wk). The 200-GDD interval consistently suppressed clipping yield. Application rate had no effect on the duration of suppression. Reapplying TE every 200 GDD provides more consistent growth regulation than a calendar-based application schedule. © Crop Science Society of America.},

  abstract = {The performance of plant growth regulators (PGRs) in turfgrass is closely related to air temperature. Growing degree-days (GDD) have been used to predict the performance of a foliar-absorbed PGR, trinexapac-ethyl (TE), on creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.). Similar models have not been attempted for paclobutrazol, a root-absorbed PGR. This research aimed to develop GDD models (base temperature = 0°C) for paclobutrazol applied alone or in combination with TE. Models were developed on creeping bentgrass putting greens in Madison, WI (2009) and near Mead, NE, (2014 and 2015). Paclobutrazol was applied alone or with TE at various rates each year. Clippings were collected several times each week and treatments were reapplied when the PGR's effects expired. Sinewave regression models fitted relative clipping yield to GDD accumulation following the most recent PGR application. Relative clipping yield from all treatments was described by symmetric sinewave regression (adjusted R2: 0.409-0.862). The intensity of clipping yield suppression, expressed by the model amplitude, ranged from 0.293 to 0.621 g g-1, depending on the application rate or the addition of TE. The application rate had less effect on the duration of the growth response, represented by the model period. The estimated reapplication intervals ranged from 269 to 302 GDD. Tripling the application rate lengthened the estimated reapplication interval by {$<$}2 d. The addition of TE did not accelerate peak suppression and had a small, inconsistent impact on the model period. Golf course superintendents should use GDD models to schedule reapplications to sustain season-long yield suppression. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {The knowledge of the properties of colloidal dispersions is fundamental for designing and optimizing the usage of clays and clay minerals. The colloidal behaviour of these dispersions is very complex due to the anisometric (and often irregular) particle shape, the anisometric and pH-dependent charge distribution, the variable particle dimensions as a consequence of swelling, delamination and exfoliation, and the ion-exchange properties. Therefore, this chapter gives information on the structure, charge distribution, structure of the hydrates, diffuse ionic layer, and the interactions between the colloidal clay mineral particles (electrostatic, van der Waals, ion correlation, steric stabilization). A large section refers to the coagulation of clay mineral dispersions by salts, the influence of organic compounds, and the destabilization (flocculation by bridging or charge neutralization) or stabilization by polymers (by recharging or steric stabilization). In a further section is described the aggregation of clay mineral particles leading to different types of sediments (decisively determining sealing, plastering, stirring, filtration processes, plasticity) or resulting in gel formation, often with thixotropic properties. Also mentioned is the preparation of colloidal metal (hydr)oxides and sulphides within the network of clay mineral particles or even between the clay mineral layers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The proximity of loess along major river valleys suggests late-Quaternary glacial meltwater sediments were dominant sediment sources for loess. Based on differing lithologies of meltwater deposits in these systems, we hypothesize that loess in each river system has a unique geochemical and mineralogical signature. To test this hypothesis, we examined pedons developed in loess parent materials, and adjacent to either the Delaware or West-Branch of the Susquehanna River, both of which carried large amounts of Wisconsinan outwash. Soils were analyzed for particle size distribution, clay mineralogy, and coarse and fine silt particle density, mineralogy, and geochemistry. Results show that while the pedons are similar in morphology, substantial differences exist in the pedons' textures, mineralogies, and geochemical compositions. We attribute the differences to parent material differences that stem from lithologically distinct sediment sources for loess from the two river systems. Susquehanna River loess has a higher particle density, and lower abundance of minerals such as Zr, base oxides (such as CaO), and rare earth elements. Discriminant analysis results suggest that developing a “loess fingerprint” for each river system based on major, minor and rare earth elements is possible, and likely to be useful in differentiating sources; however coarse silts may be a more effective fraction (than fine silts) for sediment sourcing, especially if rare earth elements are used.},

  abstract = {A force platform, which can provide three dimensional forces and moments on its top surface, was used to study force transmitted by human gait below the soil surface in order to understand detonation of antipersonnel landmines. Soils of varying depth were packed on the top surface of the platform to measure the forces transferred from the soil surface. Experimental variables included subjects (people), soil depth, soil type, moisture content, and compaction level. Soils used in this study were sand and sandy loam. There were medium and high two compaction levels for each soil. Sandy loam soil included two moisture contents; sand tested involved two moisture contents and dry sand. Soil depth varies from 0 (bare platform) to 200 mm. Five subjects with different weights were selected and used in this study. The subsoil force and its duration were measured for different subjects at a depth up to 200 mm. The impulse in subsoil was then calculated and used in evaluating the effect of different subjects on the force transfer in soil. The results indicated that loose soil can transfer larger force to subsoil than dense soil; test results showed that heavier subjects also created larger subsoil forces than lighter ones. Whether the effect of soil depth on subsoil impulse was significant was depended on the soil conditions. For the sand with 5.5\% moisture content and bulk density of 1800 kg/m3, soil depth significantly affected subsoil impulses. For the sandy loam soil, the mass of subject increased from 50 to 100 kg resulted in 100\% increase in subsoil impulses at all four depths; for the sand, the mass of subject increased from 55 to 100 kg approximately. This resulted in 80\% increase in subsoil impulses under all four depths regardless of moisture content and bulk density. The results of this study will helpful for designing new equipment and evaluating existing machines for neutralizing landmines. © 2010 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The draft needed to move the roller was also recorded. For multiple passes, subsoil forces were increased by 30\% if vertical load increased by 50\%; while the roller draft increased by 20\%. For a single pass, no significant differences detected between the subsoil forces at speeds of 1 and 3 km h-1; when the roller traveled at 5 km h-1 with a vertical load of 60 kN, the subsoil force was approximately reduced by 30\% compared to those at lower travel speeds. For both single and multiple passes, increasing travel speed did not significantly increase subsoil forces and displacement below 150-mm depth; however, the power required to drive the roller was significantly increased. Higher travel speed was more effective in creating larger subsoil displacement and subsoil forces within 100-mm from the soil surface. For similar effects below 100-mm, lower travel speed was found appropriate. © 2012 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The concept of the suction stress characteristic curve ?SSCC? for unsaturated soil is presented. Particle-scale equilibrium analyses are employed to distinguish three types of interparticle forces: ?1? active forces transmitted through the soil grains; ?2? active forces at or near interparticle contacts; and ?3? passive, or counterbalancing, forces at or near interparticle contacts. It is proposed that the second type of force, which includes physicochemical forces, cementation forces, surface tension forces, and the force arising from negative pore-water pressure, may be conceptually combined into a macroscopic stress called suction stress. Suction stress characteris- tically depends on degree of saturation, water content, or matric suction through the SSCC, thus paralleling well-established concepts of the soil–water characteristic curve and hydraulic conductivity function for unsaturated soils. The existence and behavior of the SSCC are experimentally validated by considering unsaturated shear strength data for a variety of soil types in the literature. Its characteristic nature and a methodology for its determination are demonstrated. The experimental evidence shows that both Mohr–Coulomb failure and critical state failure can be well represented by the SSCC concept. The SSCC provides a potentially simple and practical way to describe the state of stress in unsaturated soil. DOI:},

  abstract = {We propose that the recently conceptualized suction stress characteristic curve represents the effective stress for the shear strength behavior of unsaturated soil. Mechanically, suction stress is the interparticle stress called tensile stress. The working hypothesis is that the change in the energy of soil water from its free water state is mostly consumed in suction stress. We demonstrate that the suction stress lies well within the framework of continuum mechanics where free energy is the basis for any thermodynamic formulation. Available experimental data on soil water characteristic curves and suction stress characteristic curves are used to test the hypothesis, thus validating a closed‐form equation for effective stress in unsaturated soil. The proposed closed‐form equation is intrinsically related to the soil water characteristic curve by two pore parameters: the air entry pressure and pore size spectrum number. Both semiquantitative and quantitative validations show that the proposed closed‐form equation well represents effective stress for a variety of earth materials ranging from sands to clays. Of important practical implications are (1) the elimination of the need for any new shear strength criterion for unsaturated soil, (2) the elimination of the need for determining the Bishop’s effective stress parameter c because the new form of effective stress is solely a function of soil suction, and (3) the ready extension of all classical soil mechanics work on limit equilibrium analysis to unsaturated soil conditions.

X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the soil comprised kaolinite, quartz, gibbsite and haematite. Chemical analyses showed there was no amorphous material present in the soil. The results of electron scanning microscopy revealed that sesquioxides coat and bind the clayey constituents of the lateritic soil into porous micro-aggregations. Analyses of the grain size distribution and other physical properties indicated that the soil was not homogeneous within the laterite zone. Atterberg limit test results for the soil plotted anomalously below the Casagrande A-line. There were significant differences between the values of plasticity index determined for air-dried compared with oven-dried samples. High values for both the liquid and plastic limits were due to the water retention capacity of porous micro-aggregations in the soil. This was correlated with the degree of laterisation, which depends on the ambient climate, topography and vegetation of the area. © 1991.},

Depth changed soil forces more at upper parts than lower parts whereas speed affected rear parts more than the front part of the plough. Draft forces followed almost similar trend and least value of 308.17 N experimental draft force was found at 1 m/s speed and 5 cm depth under 33\% moisture content.

  abstract = {The mechanics of dynamic compaction are studied in this paper using two-dimensional finite element analyses with a large-strain dynamic formulation and a cap model for soil behaviour. Comparison with centrifuge model results shows that stress wave attenuation and improvement effects are realistically predicted. The analyses show that, in the initial blows, stress wave propagation induces transient elasto-plastic K0 compression due to lateral inertia. This preserves the plane wavefront and reduces the attenuation rate of the dynamic stresses with depth. With multiple blows, the effect changes to one of triaxial compression: this sets a limit on the degree of improve- ment that can be achieved in the near field. Deeper down, the wavefront adopts a bullet shape, and the attenuation rate rises: this sets a limit on the depth of improvement. Both these phenomena are consistent with the existence of a ‘threshold’ state that has been noted in previous literature on dynamic compaction. The results also show that the depth of improvement is dependent upon the momentum per blow, as well as on the energy per blow.},

Physical and chemical soil property data (including semi-quantitative clay mineralogy) were analyzed for 54 mineral soil horizons sampled from 18 soil profiles at seven different locations across North America. Plausible estimates of particle density for the mineral component (2.72 Mg m-3), and particularly for the humic component (1.48 Mg m-3), were obtained (r2 = 0.856, root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.035 Mg m-3, P {$<$} 0.0001) even though the calibration data set had a limited range of soil organic matter content ({$<$}23\%). Particle density was shown to vary with clay content (P {$<$} 0.05), and Dp of different mineral particle-size fractions could also be distinguished statistically. The convenient and traditional assumption of Dp = 2.65 Mg m-3 for silicate-based soils in the absence of Dp measurements is challenged, given the considerable observed variability in Dp with changes in soil organic matter content and texture.},

Study 1 results overall suggested an inability to predict the learning outcomes of educational scenarios describing the strategies of dual-coding, static-media presentations, low-interest extraneous details, testing, and spacing; there was, however, weak endorsement of the strategy of generating one's own study materials. In addition, an independent measure of metacognitive selfregulation was correlated with scenario performance. Study 2 demonstrated higher prediction accuracy for students who had received targeted instruction on applied memory topics in their psychology courses, and the best performance for those students directly exposed to the original empirical studies from which the scenarios were derived. In sum, this research suggests that undergraduates are largely unaware of several specific strategies that could benefit memory for course information; further, training in applied learning and memory topics has the potential to improve metacognitive judgments in these domains. © Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2010.},

Repetitive impacts have been associated with stress-related injuries in other sports such as running. The purpose of this investigation was to gain an understanding of the typical stresses the body experiences during common basketball moves. To this end, the ground reaction forces from 24 players from five professional basketball teams were studied. In addition, a game analysis was performed to determine the frequency of selected moves. These data indicated that certain common movements, such as jump landings and shuffling, resulted in absolute and relative forces much greater than many of those reported previously in studies of other sports. These movements were also identified in a companion paper as being associated with large angular excursions and velocities. Findings are discussed with respect to injury risks, and suggestions for future study are made.},

The objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate an apparatus to measure the horizontal forces associated with traction, compare this apparatus with other devices routinely used to quantify traction, and examine how different turfgrass stand characteristics combine to influence traction. An apparatus, termed PENNFOOT, was developed and field tested. PENNFOOT consists of a framework that supports a leg and foot assembly that can be used to measure both rotational and linear traction using different footwear under various loading weights. When we compared PENNFOOT to other traction measuring devices, the force values we obtained from different grass species and varying cutting heights provided low correlation values. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of turfgrass and soil conditions on traction of turf areas. Tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass provided the highest traction values whereas perennial ryegrass and creeping red fescue provided the lowest. Higher linear traction values occurred with lower cubing heights. Although more work is needed on the turf and soil characteristics that influence traction, the PENNFOOT with its versatility seems appropriate for traction evaluation.},

We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm—and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it—as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to “ban” p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

  abstract = {Modern compaction equipment can be outfitted with sensors that allow for real-time monitoring of the compaction process, an approach that is commonly referred to as continuous compaction control (CCC). This paper describes the results from an experimental research study that was conducted to assess the effectiveness of CCC technology for construction of a roadway embankment using a sand containing a significant percentage of silty fines. During embankment construction, simultaneous machine drive power (MDP) and compactometer value (CMV) measurements were recorded, along with the corresponding position of the roller. Location-specific in situ “spot tests” were also performed to independently assess soil compaction, including nuclear density gauge (NDG) tests, soil stiffness gauge (SSG) tests, light weight deflectometer (LWD) tests, and dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) tests. A comparison of the CCC measurements with the location-specific in situ test results was performed using spatial data analysis tools and statistical regression. The measured data, spatial and regression analysis approaches, and associated discussion that are presented provide valuable information for researchers and practitioners that are considering the use of CCC technology.},

  abstract = {Particle shape of prospective root-zone sands is evaluated qualitatively, but a quantitative shape determination may be more useful for sand selection. The objectives of this research were to: determine how particle shape complexity relates to bulk density, total porosity, and mechanical behavior (resistance to displacement given a vertical load); correlate quantitative shape parameters to these properties; determine how water content influences these relationships; and establish if quantitative shape parameters can be used to predict mechanical behavior in the absence of turfgrass roots. Seven materials of various shapes were separated into the medium size class (0.25‚Äì0.50 mm) to limit variability introduced by particle size distribution. A dynamic, digital imaging machine was used to quantify particle sphericity, symmetry, and aspect ratio. Bulk density, total porosity, and stress at multiple displacements were determined for the materials at two water contents, oven-dry and 5\% gravimetric water content. As sphericity, symmetry, and aspect ratio increased, bulk density increased and total porosity decreased. Sphericity, symmetry, and aspect ratio were negatively correlated with stress under a vertical load. The addition of water at compaction did not affect the correlations of the shape parameters with either bulk density or porosity; correlations of symmetry and sphericity with these were stronger at 5\% water content for some displacements. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sphericity can be used to predict stress characteristics of sands compacted at 5\% water content for specific testing conditions. These data indicate that particle shape complexity is related to bulk properties and has potential for predicting the stress characteristics of prospective root zone materials before construction.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature In this work we present two matheuristic procedures to build good feasible solutions (frequently, the optimal one) by considering the solutions of relaxed problems of large-sized instances of the multi-period stochastic pure 0–1 location-assignment problem. The first procedure is an iterative one for Lagrange multipliers updating based on a scenario cluster Lagrangean decomposition for obtaining strong (lower, in case of minimization) bounds of the solution value. The second procedure is a sequential one that works with the relaxation of the integrality of subsets of variables for different levels of the problem, so that a chain of (lower, in case of minimization) bounds is generated from the LP relaxation up to the integer solution value. Additionally, and for both procedures, a lazy heuristic scheme, based on scenario clustering and on the solutions of the relaxed problems, is considered for obtaining a (hopefully good) feasible solution as an upper bound of the solution value of the full problem. Then, the same framework provides for the two procedures lower and upper bounds on the solution value. The performance is compared over a set of instances of the stochastic facility location-assignment problem. It is well known that the general static deterministic location problem is NP-hard and, so, it is the multi-period stochastic version. A broad computational experience is reported for 14 instances, up to 15 facilities, 75 customers, 6 periods, over 260 scenarios and over 420 nodes in the scenario tree, to assess the validity of proposals made in this work versus the full use of a state-of the-art IP optimizer.},

This produces inter-grain cohesion and drastically modifies the mechanical properties of the granular media (e.g., the surface angle can be larger than 90 degrees). Here we present a review of the mechanical properties of wet granular media, with particular emphasis on the effect of cohesion. We also list several open problems that might motivate future studies in this exciting but mostly unexplored field.},

Unfortunately, this class of fungicide can have unwanted plant growth regulator (PGR) effects on amenity turfgrasses. Recently, a number of new DMI fungicides have been registered for turfgrasses and are seeing expanded use. To determine if differences exist in the PGR-related activity among products, a 2-year field study was conducted examining six different DMI fungicides. Fungicides were applied to creeping bentgrass maintained at 0.33 cm and applied five or six times every 14 days at equivalent active ingredient rates. The results demonstrated that although paclobutrazol statistically reduced clipping weights, there was very little effect from DMI fungicides. In the first study year, propiconazole did produce higher clipping weights on two rating dates but this was not observed in the second year. Rooting depth was unaffected by any of the chemicals in either year. Although phytotoxicity may be a concern of turfgrass managers when applying DMI fungicides during the summer, it seems unlikely that these materials applied without the additional use of labeled PGRs will have any noticeable negative effects on foliar and root growth of creeping bentgrass in New England.},

According to the United States Golf Association (USGA) specifications, appropriate particle size distributions and their shape are important for preparing putting greens and bunker sands. Despite being an important parameter, the influence of sand particle shape on the bulk mechanical properties of the rootzone mixtures has not been studied systematically using a fundamental tester. Toward this end, bulk mechanical properties were measured using a lowpressure cubical (true) triaxial tester. In this study, four of the commonly used basic shapes, i.e., round, subround, subangular, and angular sand particles comprising rootzone mixtures with sphagnum peat (organics) were tested at two different moisture levels, airdried and 30 cm moisture tension conditions. For all rootzone sand mixtures, an increase in bulk modulus was observed with increasing isotropic pressure. The failure stress values increased with the increase in mean pressure for air dried samples. In general, moisture increased compressibility of sands and decreased failure strength and shear modulus values. Peat had a dominant influence on the mechanical response of all four sand shapes. When peat and moisture were added, the rootzone mixture became most compressible and easier to fail, with noticeable changes in bulk mechanical properties.},

The general equivalence of the latter indicates that, considered globally, hillslope soil production and erosion evolve to balance geologic and climate forcing, whereas conventional plow-based agriculture increases erosion rates enough to prove unsustainable. In contrast to how net soil erosion rates in conventionally plowed fields (≈1 mm/yr) can erode through a typical hillslope soil profile over time scales comparable to the longevity of major civilizations, no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates and therefore could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {A field investigation was carried out with an instrumented vibratory roller compactor to explore the relationship between vibration characteristics and underlying soil properties, namely soil stiffness. The roller was outfitted with instrumentation to monitor drum and frame acceleration, as well as eccentric excitation force. Multiple consecutive passes were performed over six test beds on an active earthwork construction site to capture changes in roller vibration during compaction. Using lumped parameter vibration theory, soil stiffness was extracted from the roller data (drum and frame acceleration and drum phase lag). Both drum acceleration and drum phase lag were found to be very sensitive to changes in underlying soil stiffness. The drum–soil natural frequency of the coupled roller–soil system varied considerably and increased with compaction-induced soil stiffening. Phase lag always decreased with increasing soil stiffness, whereas drum acceleration trends depended on whether the excitation frequen...},

  abstract = {An investigation was conducted to characterize and relate in situ soil stress-strain behavior to roller-measured soil stiffness. Continuous assessment of soil stiffness via roller vibration monitoring has the potential to significantly advance performance based quality assurance of earthwork. One vertically homogeneous and two layered test beds were carefully constructed with embedded sensors for the field testing program. Total normal stress and strain measurements at multiple depths reveal complex triaxial soil behavior during vibratory roller loading. Measured cyclic strain amplitudes were 15-25\% of those measured during static roller passes due to viscoelasticity and curved drum/soil interaction. Low amplitude vibratory roller loading induces nonlinear in situ modulus behavior. Roller-measured stiffness and its dependence on excitation force is influenced by the stress-dependent modulus function of each soil, the varying drum/soil contact area, and by layer characteristics (modulus ratio, thickness) when layering is present. On vertically homogeneous clayey sand, roller-measured stiffness decreased with increasing excitation force, a behavior attributed to stress-dependent modulus reduction observed in situ. On the crushed rock over silt test bed, roller-measured stiffness increased with increasing excitation force despite the mild stress-dependent modulus reduction observed in the crushed rock. In this case, the stiffer crushed rock takes on a greater portion of the load, resulting in the increase in roller-measured stiffness.},

Test beds were constructed in lifts with controlled thickness and instrumented with stress and strain sen- sors. A composite assessment of roller-measured stiffness on individual lifts throughout construction revealed that measurement depths ranged from 0.9 to 1.2 m using two common-sized vibratory rollers. For overlying material layer thickness greater than the measurement depth, roll- er-measured stiffness was found to be a function of the overlying material only. Otherwise, roller stiffness was a function of the two materials. Measurement depth was not significantly influenced by the layer material stiffness ratio. The sensitivity of roller-measured stiffness to thin lifts of material (e.g. 0.2 m) was found to depend on the stiffness ratio of the two materials. Data from in-ground instrumentation supported by elastic theory revealed that, at the experimentally observed measurement depths, both the total and cyclic stress and strain were approximately 10\% of their maximum values. An analysis of cyclic strain profiles from three different soils revealed that the measurement depth is weakly dependent on excitation force amplitude. For the two rollers used, measurement depth ranged from 0.8 m under low excitation force to 1.2 m under high excitation force.},

  abstract = {The standard thread rolling method for determining the plastic limit of soil, PL, has been widely criticized for requiring considerable judgment from the operator that carries out the test. In different studies other methods have been put forward; however, these methods cannot compete with the thread rolling test in simplicity, execution time and cost. In this article an accurate, quick and simple method is presented with a simple device for determining the plastic limit of soils, in which the subjective point of view of the operator is omitted. Soil threads which are 3. mm in diameter and 52. mm long are bent until they start to crack. The relationship between the bending produced, B, and water content, W, has been studied, in such a way that the plastic limit, PL, and another two new parameters (the stiff-soft limit, SSL, and the bend-breaking limit, BL) have been determined with minimal operator interference. These new parameters delimit other consistency states, which may be very useful in sectors such as the ceramics industry, agriculture or geotechnical engineering. The PL results obtained by the bending test in 24 soils concur to a great degree with those obtained in the thread rolling test by a highly experienced operator (R\textsuperscript{2}=0.972). Moreover, these results have been endorsed by Shapiro-Wilk and Student's T statistics tests. Finally, the reliability of the method using only 3 and 1 experimental points has been studied too which have yielded very similar results to those obtained with 6 and 7 points.},

  abstract = {Although plastic limit (PL) is one of the parameters more widely used in the field of geotechnical engineering, the existing method for its determination (the thread-rolling test) is characterized by its low accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility. These shortcomings have led to a great deal of criticisms, and in fact, several authors have tried to develop alternative methods to obtain the PL in soils. Despite that, the standardized thread-rolling method remains strong because of its simplicity, low cost, and quick performance. In previous studies, an alternative method, which was based on bending soil threads of 3mm in diameter and 52mm long until they start to crack, was presented by the authors. The relationship between the water content and the measured bending deformations allows the PL to be calculated with an equation. Apart from this, two other additional parameters associated with the soil consistency changes were defined: the bend-breaking limit (BL) and the stiff-soft limit (SSL). In the present study new equations are presented to calculate these parameters with only one experimental point. By means of their respective equations, PL, BL, and SSL have been calculated in 55 soils. The results of PL and plasticity index (PI) achieved with this test are highly correlated with those obtained through the standardized rolling test by a highly experienced laboratory operator. The Casagrande chart has been interpreted according to the PL, BL, and SSL in order to uncover more information about this system for soil classification, and after detecting some incongruities, a new proposal is presented.},

  abstract = {Clays are key elements not only in geological and environmental processes, but also in many human activities. To differentiate clays from other soils, AIPEA and CMS highlight plasticity as the clays' most distinctive characteristic. However, the lack of any reliable plasticity yardstick makes the particle-size-criteria to be more widespread. In a previous work, the authors found some innovative ratios between the plasticity index (PI) and the liquid limit (LL) which allowed the clays' boundary to be established according to a plasticity basis. As plasticity is directly associated with toughness, different published data containing valuable information have been processed in this study by plotting toughness values against PI/LL ratios. In this way, the soundness of the previous authors' finding has been checked. It is demonstrated that a fine-grained material can be defined as a clay when PI ≥ LL/2, while a material is moderately or slightly clayey if LL/3 {$<$} PI {$<$} LL/2, such that when PI ≤ LL/3 the influence of clay minerals is much reduced. Apart from an updated classification of soil for engineering purposes, a new textural soil classification is presented, alternative to the USDA one, which allows the real nature of a soil to be known accurately by means of plasticity tests and simple sieving instead of particle-size sedimentation methods.},

  abstract = {Soil classification systems represent powerful tools not only to facilitate soil identification, but also to predict its possible behavior. While the use of arbitrary standards based on particle size distribution may be applicable to coarse-grained soils, those approaches based exclusively on textural principles are ineffective in classifying fine-grained soils, where clay content and its mineralogy dictate the general properties. In this sense, the measurement of plasticity represents a more appropriate parameter than particle size. This fact has led various authors and technical committees to develop fine-grained soil classification systems based on plasticity. However, the disparity of criteria makes it necessary to review them in order to glimpse the weaknesses and strengths of each of them. This paper includes the review of the six main existing proposals together with the possible variants arising from them: Casagrande (1947)-Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), Saito and Miki (1975), Polidori (2003, 2007, 2009) and Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate (2017, 2018) classification charts, which are designed on the basis of Atterberg limits. After conducting a complete and thorough examination, it is shown that although the Casagrande (1947)-USCS approach is the most widely known, of all the proposals examined, only that of Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate (2017, 2018) is based on well-founded criteria, presenting a strong predictive capacity, as well as being simple, precise and adaptable to needs.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the CCM for the arable layer of 10 agricultural soils (sandy loam to clay textures) from semi-arid regions in western Iran. The results were compared with conventional soil workability limits such as 0.85 of the soil plastic limit (0.85θ PL), Proctor critical water content (θ Proctor), 0.6 or 0.7 of water content at matric suction of 50hPa (0.6-0.7θ 50hPa), and the Kretschmer optimum water content (θ Kretschmer=θ PL-0.15(θ LL-θ PL)) where θ LL is the soil liquid limit.

A methodology that could be used for estimating the maximum gravimetric soil water content for optimum tillage would be helpful to prevent soil structural damage. The objective of this study was to compare five methods for estimating the soil water content for tillage. These methods utilized existing data of water retention, Atterberg limits, and Proctor compaction tests. The database included 80 soils, 51 from Germany and 29 from north central USA. Additionally, on three sites in Germany, soil water content in the field was measured intensively and related to the estimates of soil water content for workability. Maximum soil water content for optimum tillage of cohesive soils was at a consistency index of 1.15 and 90\% of the water content at the lower plastic limit. For both cohesive and non-cohesive soils, the maximum soil water content for optimum workability was equal to either the water content at maximum Proctor density or 70\% of the water content at a tension of -5 kPa. At the water content of the inflection point of the water retention curve, in many cases the soil would be too wet for tillage. The results provide methods for estimation of the maximum water content for optimum tillage from databases with existing soil physical properties. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Tillage causes changes to soil structure, and if the soil is too wet when tillage is performed, the change to the soil structure will be detrimental. A methodology that could be used for estimating the maximum gravimetric soil water content for optimum tillage would be helpful to prevent soil structural damage. The objective of this study was to compare five methods for estimating the soil water content for tillage. These methods utilized existing data of water retention, Atterberg limits, and Proctor compaction tests. The database included 80 soils, 51 from Germany and 29 from north central USA. Additionally, on three sites in Germany, soil water content in the field was measured intensively and related to the estimates of soil water content for workability. Maximum soil water content for optimum tillage of cohesive soils was at a consistency index of 1.15 and 90\% of the water content at the lower plastic limit. For both cohesive and non-cohesive soils, the maximum soil water content for optimum workability was equal to either the water content at maximum Proctor density or 70\% of the water content at a tension of −5 kPa. At the water content of the inflection point of the water retention curve, in many cases the soil would be too wet for tillage. The results provide methods for estimation of the maximum water content for optimum tillage from databases with existing soil physical properties.},

The clay minerals are important in construction where they are a major constituent in brick and tile. The physical and chemical properties of the clay minerals determine their utilization in the process industries.What about tomorrow? Processing techniques will be improved and new equipment will be available so that improved clay mineral products will be available. Pillared clays and nanocomposites will become important. Further developments in organoclay technology and surface treatments will provide new usages for these special clays. Tomorrow will see further growth and utilization of the clay minerals.},

These kaolins occur as Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary age lenses and beds which were derived from weathered granites, gneisses, and phyllites on the Piedmont Plateau. The fall line is the boundary between the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont Plateau and the Coastal Plain sediments to the southeast. The Tertiary kaolins are generally larger in areal extent and thicker than the Cretaceous kaolins. The soft kaolins contain a large quantity of coarse stacks interspersed in a matrix of finer platy particles. The hard kaolins contain thin platy particles with no large books or stacks.},

However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination of sedimented aggregates of montmorillonite indicate that the effective number of unit cells that are diffracting coherently is ∼9. This discrepancy can be reconciled by postulating an interparticle diffraction effect from the sedimented aggregates of oriented particles. The interfaces of these particles are capable of adsorbing water, ethylene glycol etc. so that on this basis smectite is composed of elementary silicate particles 10 Å thick, and regularly interstratified I-S is primarily composed of elementary ‘illite’ particles 20 Å thick, values which are in agreement with the TEM observations. This concept is confirmed experimentally by XRD examination of sedimented aggregates from mixed suspensions of both materials; the resulting patterns are identical to those of randomly interstratified illite and smectite layers, which indicates that the layer sequence examined by XRD has been entirely rearranged. It is concluded that the use of XRD peak breadth to determine mean crystal thickness cannot be reliably applied to these systems. Standard XRD data from sedimented aggregates may not be able to distinguish between true interstratification and interparticle diffraction effects of intimate physical mixtures.},

  abstract = {Regulating ball response to impact is one way to control ball exit velocity in baseball. This is necessary to reduce injuries to defensive players and maintain the balance between offense and defense in the game. This paper presents a model for baseball velocity-dependent behavior. Force-displacement data were obtained using quasi-static compression tests to 50\% of ball diameter (n = 70 baseballs). The force-displacement curves for a very stiff baseball (Model B) and a softer type (Model C) were characterized by a Mooney-Rivlin model using implicit finite element analysis (ANSYS software, version 6.1). Agreement between experimental and numerical results was excellent for both Model B (C(10) = 0, C(01) = 3.7e(6) Pa) and Model C (C(10) = 0, C(01) = 2.6e(6) Pa). However, this material model was not available in the ANSYS/LSDYNA explicit dynamic software (version 6.1) used to quantify the transient behavior of the ball. Therefore the modeling process was begun again using a linear viscoelastic material. G(infinity), the long-term shear modulus of the material, was determined by the same implicit FEA procedure. Explicit FEA was used to quantify the time-dependent response of each ball in terms of instantaneous shear modulus (G0) and a decay term (beta). The results were evaluated with respect to published experimental data for the ball coefficient of restitution at five velocities (13.4-40.2 ms(-1)) and were in agreement with the experimental values. The model forms the basis for future research on baseball response to impact with the bat.},

  abstract = {Layers cemented by iron and manganese have been observed in soils of putting greens at golf courses throughout the USA. They result in reduced water infiltration, saturated conditions in the root zone, and a decline in turfgrass density and quality. The physical and chemical properties of these layers have not been investigated nor described in detail. Here we present a detailed analysis of the physicochemical properties and a conceptual pedogenetic model for the formation of Fe-cemented layers in soils of golf putting greens across the USA. These man-made soils have an A horizon of about 5 to 10cm over 20 to 30cm sand (C horizon) over gravel. The Fe-cemented layer is commonly found at the interface of the A and C horizons, or the C horizon and the gravel layer. Levels of total Fe in the cemented layers range from 0.41 to 16.21gkg-1 and these are accompanied by accumulations of SOC and sometimes high levels of Mn and Al. The downward movement of water (irrigation), high levels of Fe (fertilization), and a textural discontinuity are key factors in the formation of the Fe-cemented layer. The layers may form at rates as high as 1.5mm per year depending on Fe content and redox conditions in the root zone, and may become cemented in 10years. These cemented layers meet the criteria of the placic horizon in Soil Taxonomy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The paper examines the effect of the presence of small percentages (1–5\%) by dry mass of the sand of laponite – a synthetic nanoclay with plasticity index exceeding 1000\% – on the cyclic response of sand with relative density in the 15–25\% range. The work is based on cyclic triaxial tests performed on specimens prepared pluviating sand and laponite under dry conditions and then permeated with water. 1\% laponite impacts all stages of the cyclic tests, from the response during the first loading cycle to liquefaction, increasing the cyclic resistance. Further benefits are observed with a longer pre-shear aging period or higher dosages (3–5\%) of laponite. The observed behavior is associated with reduced mobility of the sand particles during cyclic loading, which can be ascribed to two mechanisms: (1) bonding/bridging at the particle contacts due to the charged laponite fines which are attracted to the sand grains; and (2) formation of a pore fluid with solid like properties. The first appears to control the behavior with 1\% laponite, while it is proposed that the second is responsible for the response with higher dosages of laponite. The results presented provide new insight into the effects of high plastic fines on the cyclic response of sands, the “extreme” effects of the plasticity of the fines, and are significant in light of the possible use of laponite for liquefaction mitigation, an idea first put forth by the authors.}

As the PL does not correspond to a unique value of remoulded undrained shear strength, there is no scientific reason why PL measurements obtained using the thread-rolling and shear-strength-based fall-cone or extrusion methods should coincide. Various correlations are established relating liquid limit values deduced using the percussion-cup and fall-cone approaches. The significance of differences in the strain-rate dependency on the mobilised fall-cone shear strength is reviewed. The paper concludes with recommendations on the standardisation of international codes and the wider use of the fall-cone approach for soft to medium-stiff clays in establishing the strength variability with changing water content and furth...},

Modeling of mixing and segregation processes requires the confluence of several tools, including continuum and discrete descriptions (particle dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, cellular automata computations) and, often, considerable geometrical insight. None of these viewpoints, however, is wholly satisfactory by itself. Moreover, continuum and discrete descriptions of granular flows are regime dependent, and this fact may require adopting different subviewpoints. This review organizes a body of knowledge that formsalbeit imperfectlythe beginnings of an expandable continuum framework for the description of mixing and segregation of granular materials. We focus primarily on noncohesive particles, possibly differing in size, density, shape, etc. We present segregation mechanisms and models for size and density segregation and introduce chaotic advection, which appears in noncircular tumblers. Chaotic advection interacts in nontrivial ways with segregation in granular materials and leads to unique equilibrium structures that serve as a prototype for systems displaying organization in the midst of disorder.},

In addition to providing topographic measuring tools, molaR has complimentary plotting functions enabling highly customizable visualization of results. This article gives a detailed description of the DNE measure, walks researchers through installing, operating, and troubleshooting molaR and its functions, and gives an example of a simple comparison that measured teeth of the primates Alouatta and Pithecia in molaR and other available software packages. molaR is a free and open source software extension, which can be found at the doi:10.13140/RG.2.1.3563.4961 (molaR v. 2.0) as well as on the Internet repository CRAN, which stores R packages.},

Differences exist among Kentucky bluegrass cultivars for seasonal performance characteristics such as spring green-up and summer stress tolerance. The objective of this study was to determine whether the wear tolerance and recovery of Kentucky bluegrass cultivars were dependent on season. Twenty-two Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, representing nine genetically diverse Kentucky bluegrass types, were established in September 2002 in North Brunswick, NJ on a loam. The effects of simulated wear were evaluated during spring, summer, and fall in 2004 and 2005. Generally, Kentucky bluegrass was more tolerant of wear during spring than summer or fall and recovery was more rapid after spring wear. The performance of many cultivars depended on season of wear; however, 'Julia' consistently exhibited the greatest wear tolerance as well as recovery. Compact-Midnight Type cultivars ('Midnight', 'Midnight II', and 'Liberator') had good wear tolerance during fall wear, however were slow to recover after fall wear. 'Cabernet', 'Lakeshore', 'Moon Shadow', 'Limousine', and 'Jefferson' exhibited more rapid recovery from fall wear during the next spring. 'Langara', 'Bedazzled', and 'Touchdown' had poor wear tolerance and recovery during all seasons. The season(s) of play should be considered when selecting Kentucky bluegrass cultivars for sports fields. © Crop Science Society of America.},

  abstract = {This new edition provides an in-depth introduction to the theories and applications of the powder diffraction method for structure determination. The emphasis is placed on powder diffraction data collected using conventional x-ray sources, which remain primary tools for thousands of researchers and students in their daily experimental work. The book is divided into two parts: chapters one though fifteen give essential theoretical background, while chapters sixteen through twenty-five guide the reader through practical aspects of extracting structural information from powder data. Fundamentals of Powder Diffraction and Structural Characterization of Materials, Second Edition is suited for undergraduate and graduate students and practitioners from materials science, solid-state chemistry, physics, geology, and literally any other science or engineering background, who demand structural information at the atomic resolution using the powder diffraction method. Key features of the second edition: The book requires no prior knowledge of the subject, but is comprehensive and detailed making it useful for both the novice and experienced user of the powder diffraction method.While developed as a text to teach students, the book is also a reference for academic and industrial researchers using the powder diffraction method in their daily work.Major revisions includeexpanded treatment of non-crystallographic symmetrybrief introductions to the total scattering analysis and non-ambient powder diffractometrybasics of quantitative analysis using the Rietveld method, including determination of amorphous contentaddition of a difficult pseudo-symmetric indexing caseexpanded coverage of direct space structure solution techniquesan introduction to the mechanism of constraints, restraints and rigid bodies and a new example of structure solution of a pharmaceutical compoundadditional problems to help in assessment of students' progress. The book is supplemented by online content, including color figures, powder diffraction data, examples, and web links.},

  abstract = {In the first section, the author presents a detailed analysis of fundamental processes of pedological evolution in the light of the latest findings as to biogeochemical, mineralogical and granulometric aspects of pedogenesis on crystalline aluminosilicate rocks. This analysis is based on the nature of various geochemical weathering phenomena, on the one hand, and on problems related to the organization of plasmic elements (pédoplasmation) and their possible transfers as particles, on the other. With reference to the latter aspect, two major types of "pedogenesis" may be considered: "associative" pedogenesis in which plasma-skeleton links are kept, and "dissociative" pedogenesis in which plasma-skeleton links are disrupted and plasma is redistributed. Then, in the second section, a structuring of fundamental pedogenetic processes is proposed, based on the observation of three major phyla at the earth surface. Phylum I: Process with predominant biogeochemical evolution without plasma formation or with plasma destruction. Phylum II: Process with predominant biogeochemical evolution with plasma formation and reorganization in situ. Phylum III: Process with predominant textural evolution with plasma mobilization and redistribution. © 1983.},

Measurements of strains, gravimetric water content and suction allow the drawing of some conclusions about the influence and the evolution of these tensile stresses during drying.

It was observed that the liquid limit and plastic limit values of the mixtures tested, except those with a low clay percentage, are linked to the respective clay size contents by a linear relationship. The Atterberg limits were subsequently recalculated using the equations of the regression lines of the mixtures governed by linear law with the clay percentages. The plotting of the plastic limit as a function of the liquid limit of these data made it possible to determine the relationship among the liquid limit, the plastic limit and clay fraction valid for inorganic soils that contain platey clay minerals and for clay size contents that are not too low. Hence, on the basis of the interdependence among the parameters considered (WL, Wp, Ip, CF, A), for a given inorganic soil, knowing only two of three parameters (WL, Wp, CF) that are measurable using standard tests, the values of other three parameters can be obtained.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n},

  abstract = {Plastic limit (PL) and optimum moisture content (OMC) laboratory tests are essential for any earthwork construction since they play a significant role in any newly started construction site. But it takes an excessive amount of time to determine OMC. Many of the index properties were found to be related to compaction parameters, optimum moisture content, and maximum dry density. The plasticity indices and the proportion of particles had the most significant connections, with the plastic limit having the highest degree of simple correlation. As a result, using the plastic limit of soil, it is necessary to determine these compaction properties. If compaction properties are correlated to plastic limit, it may be easier to determine OMC. Finally, a simple equation has been generated to obtain the optimum moisture content (OMC) and the plastic limit (PL) of all the fine-grained soil. A useful equation and many graphical approaches have been used for quickly predicting compaction characteristics from index properties. The accuracy of these equations and graphical approaches has been assessed in this paper and determined to be adequate with most prediction results. This proposed correlation is going to be an easier method for engineers in quickly assessing their suitability for compaction related purposes.},

In order to evaluate their safety several factors have been analyzed including the baseball bat coefficient of restitution, the tram-poline effect, the durability of the bat and its constituent materials. In this study, a novel, patented, reinforced wooden baseball bat has been examined to determine its durability and safety relative to traditional wooden bats. Results based on a finite element analysis using ANSYS software have demonstrated that this reinforced bat reduces the stress of impact with a baseball, increasing the useable lifespan of the bat. Furthermore, after thorough and consistent use, results suggest that the reinforced bat is both more durable and safer because it takes longer to break than a traditional bat and, when it does break, it cracks instead of splintering and becoming a projectile. © 2012 TMS.},

  abstract = {Low red light/far-red light ratio (R:FR) serves as an indicator of impending competition and has been demonstrated to suppress branch development. The regulation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rosette bud outgrowth by the R:FR and the associated mechanisms were investigated at several levels. Growth under low R:FR suppressed outgrowth of the third from topmost bud (bud n-2) but not that of the topmost bud. Subsequently increasing the R:FR near the time of anthesis promoted bud n-2 outgrowth and reduced topmost bud growth. Buds from specific rosette positions, exhibiting divergent fates to increased R:FR, were harvested 3 h after modifying the R:FR and were used to conduct ATH1 microarray-based transcriptome profiling. Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment of light signaling and hormone-related Gene Ontology terms and promoter motifs, most notably those associated with abscisic acid (ABA). Genes associated with ABA biosynthesis, including the key biosynthetic gene NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3 (NCED3), and with ABA signaling were expressed at higher levels in the responsive bud n-2, and increasing the R:FR decreased their expression only in bud n-2. ABA abundance in responsive buds decreased within 12 h of increasing the R:FR, while indole-3-acetic acid levels did not change. A role for ABA in repressing bud outgrowth from lower positions under low R:FR was demonstrated using the nced3-2 and aba2-1 ABA biosynthesis mutants, which showed enhanced branching and a defective bud n-2 outgrowth response to low R:FR. The results provide evidence that ABA regulates bud outgrowth responses to the R:FR and thus extend the known hormonal pathways associated with the regulation of branching and shade avoidance.},

Several methodologies exist to determine the PL and LL, each with associated merits and shortcomings. The reproducibility and uncertainties associated with the various methods have not been evaluated for different samples that differ in terms of clay mineralogy and geologic origin. The objectives were to (i) assess the repeatability of two methods each for determining the PL (thread rolling and rolling device) and LL (Casagrande cup and drop cone penetrometer), and compare the subsequent plasticity indexes for 30 samples from 10 countries; and (ii) evaluate the effect of particle size (2~mm and 425~µm) on the plastic and liquid limits for 28 Venezuelan samples. For the PL, the repeatability (estimated as the repeatability coefficient, RC, among replications) for the thread rolling and rolling device methods was similar (2.28 and 2.39\%, respectively). For the LL, the drop cone method was 16\% more repeatable than the Casagrande cup method. There was a strong correlation between the two respective methods for PL (r2~=~0.98) and LL (r2~=~0.99). For samples that have LL~{$<~$}45, the LL from the Casagrande cup was slightly higher than LL from the drop cone, and vice versa for samples with LL~{$>~$}45\%. No significant differences were observed between PL measured on~{$<$}2-mm or~{$<$}425-µm samples; for samples with LL~{$<~$}35\% the two particle sizes gave similar values. There were however larger discrepancies between the two particle sizes for samples with LL~{$>~$}36\%.},

The particle size distribution, i.e. the number of particles of different sizes, is responsible for important physical and chemical properties such as: mechanical bulk behavior, surface reaction, taste, miscibility, filtration properties and conductivity This list could be continued at great length. The examples clearly show how important it is to have knowledge of the particle distribution, particularly within the context of quality assurance in the production of bulk goods. If the particle distribution changes during the manufacturing process then the quality of the finished product will also change. Only a continuous monitoring of the particle size distribution can guarantee a constant product quality. Particle size determination methods There are different methods for determining the particle distribution. The choice of a particular method depends primarily on the dispersion status, i.e. on the degree of fineness of the sample. The oldest and best-known method is particle size determination by sieve analysis. The particle size distribution is defined via the mass or volume. Sieve analysis is used to divide the granular material into size fractions and then to determine the weight of these fractions. In this way a relatively broad particle size spectrum can be analyzed quickly and reliably.},

A statistician often is facing with this problem: he has some observations of a quantitative character x1, x2, xn and he wishes to test if those observations, being a sample of an unknown population, belong from a population with a pdf (probability density function) f(x,θ), where θ is a vector of parameters to estimate with available data. We can identify 4 steps in fitting distributions: 1) Model/function choice: hypothesize families of distributions; 2) Estimate parameters; 3) Evaluate quality of fit; 4) Goodness of fit statistical tests. This paper aims to face fitting distributions dealing shortly with theoretical issues and practical ones using the statistical environment and language R1. R is a language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics flexible and powerful. We are going to use some R statements concerning graphical techniques 2.0), model/function choice 3.0), parameters estimate 4.0), measures of goodness of fit 5.0) and most common goodness of fit tests 6.0). To understand this work a basic knowledge of R is needed. We suggest a reading of An introduction to R2. R statements, if not specified, are included in stats package.},

  abstract = {"In studying the effects of management practices on sod production an objective means for measuring sod strength has been needed. The extent of root and rhizome growth determines whether sod is ready to be harvested. A device was constructed to obtain an estimate of the contribution of roots and rhizomes to sod strength by determining the weight required to tear a piece of sod 40 cm wide. One-half of the sod piece is clamped on a stationary platform; the other portion on a portable platform which is attached by a cable to a metal container. Silica sand is added to the container at a constant rate to provide a uniform increase in stress. Sod strength is recorded as the weight required to tear the sod piece at the interface between the platforms. The sod must be cut at a uniform depth for consistent results. Good correlation was found between sod strength measurements and root and rhizome weights as influenced by nitrogen treatments. In evaluation of selected species and varieties for sod production, consistent differences in sod strength were observed ranging from 15 to 40 kg. This technique provides a useful research tool for evaluating management factors in sod production."}

To realize this potential, the relationship between the roller-measured soil stiffness and the soil modulus, particularly resilient modulus, must be understood. This paper compares the in-situ stress states and paths experienced by soil beneath a vibratory roller with stress states/paths during laboratory resilient modulus testing. Observed stress fields within the 1 m depth of influence varied considerably for both vertically homogeneous embankment soil and layered base over subgrade conditions. During low excitation force vibration, roller induced levels of deviator stress were notably greater than those used during laboratory resilient modulus testing, while levels of mean stress were less. Predicted modulus variation with depth is strongly influenced by modulus function parameters. Using typical granular soil parameters, modulus was found to be constant with depth for the embankment conditions. With modulus parameters of more fine-grained behavior, modulus increased considerably with depth.},

Here I introduce the broom package, which turns the output of model objects into tidy data frames that are suited to further analysis, manipulation, and visualization with input-tidy tools. Broom defines the "tidy", "augment" and "glance" generics, which arrange a model into three levels of tidy output respectively: the component level, the observation level, and the model level. I provide examples to demonstrate how these generics work with tidy tools to allow analysis and modeling of data that is divided into subsets, to recombine results from bootstrap replicates, and to perform simulations that investigate the effect of varying input parameters.},

Results showed excellent agreement between volume and bulk density measurements obtained by the two methods across a wide range of textural classes. Use of the technology has several important advantages over the traditional clod method. The nondestructive nature of the scanning method makes it possible to use the same intact ped or clod for other purposes, such as thin sections for micromorphological analysis. In addition, high-resolution digital imaging opens up possibilities for new physical measurements of soil morphological features. © Soil Science Society of America All rights reserved.},

The unknown coefficients were obtained by least mean-square fitting with the soil displacement curve measured through a sophisticated laboratory soil bin test. Those coefficients were then re-derived as a function of depth. The movement of soil particles at the ground contact surface was modeled by dividing movement into two kinds; first, the free movement of soil particles before contact with the wheel and the movement of the particles after they are separated from the wheel surface and, second, soil movement during attachment to the wheel surface. By combining the models for the ground contact surface of the wheel with that for all soil layers, an extended model that can describe soil displacement increment in both vertical and horizontal directions using one equation was established. The predicted results obtained using the extended model fitted quite well with the measured values. The predicted strain increment distributions also show the same trends as the measured distributions. © 2012 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of structural components on the in situ mechanical behaviour of third-generation artificial turf football pitches. In total, 21 pitches were analysed according to the specified FIFA procedures. The results revealed that each of the pitches complies with the requirements of FIFA regulations. Pile length sample, stabilising bulk density, tuft/m(2) and sub-base material all demonstrated a significant influence on the mechanical properties of the surface (p{$<$}0.05). Finally, the selected structural parameters explained 77.9\%, 59.8\% and 54.3\% of variance in rotational traction, vertical deformation and force reduction, respectively. These results show the importance of the selection of the structural components in the design of artificial turf football pitches.}

Results from the pot experiment indicated that the production of rhizomes, roots and percent total available carbohydrate depend not only on one single nutrient but rather on two or more nutrients applied to the soil. The fertilizers themselves affected differently on the production of rhizomes, roots and percent total available carbohydrate at different times. Nitrogen reduced the production of rhizomes in later stage of growth. In the early stage it tended to increase rhizome production. Phosphorus fertilization increased rhizome production at a decreasing rate as higher P was applied. Potassium decreased rhizome production if it was applied above 100 pounds per acre. Negative interactions between N X P and P X K tended to reduce the yield of rhizome. Percent total available carbohydrate in the rhizomes was poorly correlated with N, P and K applied. Higher application of N and K reduced percent total available carbohydrate. Less correlation between percent total available carbohydrate and the yield of rhizome existed as the grass matured. Root production was highly correlated with rhizome production. The effect of N, P and K fertilizers applied on root production was similar as that on the rhizome. Variation in plant composition was also affected by two or more nutrients applied rather than by a single nutrient. Percent P was mostly affected by P fertilizer application. Percent P was also increased by addition of N fertilizers. The most important element causing variation in percent K was potassium. Nitrogen application tended to increase percent K; percent Ca in the leaves was mostly affected by K application, it reduced percent Ca at higher K rates. Percent Mg was reduced by the addition of N, especially when P was also applied at 100 pounds. The most important fertilizer element causing the variation of percent Mg was potassium. A field experiment conducted from May through October 1965, showed that maximum rhizomes, roots and percent total available carbohydrate were obtained in the month of September. It was also the month in which the treatment effects were fully expressed. The relation between the amount of rhizome and root produced and the sod strength was not close especially with regard to the P and K fertilizer application. The average effect of N fertilizer, did show a relationship. Potassium applicaiton did not contribute to increase production of rhizome, root and percent total avalable carbohydrate when the soil tested 869-1603 ppm of K. Another field experiment was carried out from July through September 1966. The purpose was to study the effects of combinations of cutting heights and nitrogen rates on rhizome and root production and also on sod strength. Cutting the grass at 2 1/4 and 1 1/2 inch heights produced the highest rhizome and root yield and also the highest sod strength. Fifteen pounds of nitrogen per acre per month yielded the maximum rhizome, root and sod strength."},

  abstract = {Eighteenth-century British gentleman farmer Jethro Tull (1674-1741) is popularly regarded as the inventor of the seed drill, widely cited by agricultural historians, soil scientists and school history textbooks alike. Whether Tull was in fact the first to experiment with a mechanical seed drill and the horse-drawn cultivators drilling made possible is doubtful, but he did do much to make their acceptance in the long run more widespread. What is less well known is that Tull's mechanical innovations were accompanied by a theory of plant nutrition-and a social agenda-that were equally important to the adoption of the new machines. Although he came to be celebrated by later generations, Tull's work attracted fierce critics in his own day and immediately after, not least because he categorically rejected the value of manures in maintaining soil fertility. Instead, he proposed a mechanistic theory of plant nutrition in which the stirring of the soil with the cultivator could substitute for the processes of decomposition thought to be contributed by manures, with less labor and expense. For Tull, the drill was part of an explicit strategy to minimize reliance on an unruly labor force. He also directly challenged the idea that Virgil and other classical authorities could be of any practical use in farm management. In other words, Tull was an anti-georgic improver, and could only be reinserted into the canon of agricultural history through the efforts of later agriculturists to gloss over the objectionable parts of his work. This paper explores how, a century before Liebig, Tull's Horse-Hoeing Husbandry (1731 and later editions) sparked heated debates over a constellation of issues that are still with us today: no-till vs. tillage, net profits vs. gross yields, soil biology vs. soil chemistry, yield per acre vs. yield per unit of labor, rotation costs vs. input costs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research was to characterize and interpret the coarse basal zones that are common in thin loess deposits that overlie coarser-textured sediment. To that end, we sampled nine pedons in northeastern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, each of which had formed in thin (≤55 cm) loess over sandy glacial sediment. At most of these sites, the loess became noticeably coarser near the lithologic discontinuity. The loess has a primary particle size mode in the coarse silt or fine, very fine sand fraction (≈30- 65 μm) and a secondary mode in the fine or medium sand fraction (≈200-400 μm). We attribute the secondary mode to mixing of underlying sands into the loess, either during loess deposition or by post-depositional pedoturbation. In thin loess, pedoturbation processes can penetrate into the underlying sediment, facilitating mixing upward as far as 50 cm into the loess. Silt from the loess has also been mixed into the underlying sandy sediment. Alternatively, in some pedons, the loess itself coarsens with depth; the particle size mode for the loess becomes increasingly coarser with depth. This coarsening suggests that, during loess deposition, one or more of the following was occurring: (1) wind velocities were decreasing over time, (2) the textural character of the loess source area(s) were changing/decreasing, or (3) additional source areas-with finer-textured sediment-became more dominant over time. Our research demonstrates the utility of detailed particle size data for detecting and interpreting the paleoenvironmental history of loess. We also document the extent to which pedoturbation can impact the original textural characteristics of loess (or any sediment) that occurs as a thin surficial mantle. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show what ancient structures are made of and what can be done with today’s materials to produce more sustainable modern concrete. Some samples of mortars collected from the Tipasa archaeological site and the Forbidden City site were submitted to XRD and SEM analysis. The samples from Tipasa were predominately calcined clay and/or lime. The samples from the Forbidden site consisted of wood, clay, and dolomite. The main binder in both cases was a type of C-A-S-H gel occasionally containing Mg, K, and/or Cl. Most of today’s structures are based on portland cement. Achieving sustainable-development goals generally includes replacing part of the cement in concrete with industrial waste or calcined clay, especially metakaolin. More recently, wastepaper sludge ash (WSA) from the pulp and paper industry (possibly containing a certain quantity of metakaolin as well as some C3A and C2S) has been used in concrete. A microstructural study of hardened cement paste containing 40\% WSA revealed the formation of hydrated products such as a type of C-A-S-H gel, ettringite, and calcium carboaluminate.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate various protocols for rapidly measuring PSD using the laser diffraction technique, compare the obtained PSD with those determined using the traditional hydrometer-and-sieves method (HSM), and assess the accuracy of soil hydraulic properties predicted from the measured PSD. Ten soil samples encompassing a wide textural range were analyzed using the HSM and 3 different laser diffraction methods (LDM1, LDM2, and LDM3). In LDM1, the soil sample was thoroughly mixed before analysis. In LDM2, the sand fraction was sieved out and analyzed separately from the silt-clay fraction. LDM3 was similar to LDM2 except that the silt-clay fraction was diluted so that a large sample volume could be used while maintaining an acceptable level of obscuration. LDM2 and LDM3 improved the agreement between the PSD with the HSM in comparison to LDM1, without the need of altering the Mie theory parameters or the use of scaling factors. Moreover, a reasonable prediction of measured saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention curve was achieved when using the PSD from LDM2 and LDM3, in conjunction with bulk density information.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traction is influenced by the sole architecture and playing surface, with increases in traction potentially leading to injury. The mechanism as to how or why increased traction could lead to injury remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine how shoes of different sole designs and traction influence knee and ankle joint moments. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Traction testing was performed on 2 shoes of varying sole designs (tread vs smooth) using a robotic testing machine. All testing was conducted on a 60-cm x 90-cm piece of sample track surface. Kinematic and kinetic data were then collected on 13 recreational athletes performing running V-cuts in the 2 different shoe conditions. Five trials per condition were collected with reflective markers placed on the right shank and shoe of each participant. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using an 8-high-speed camera system and force plate. RESULTS: The coefficient of translational traction and the peak moment of rotation were both significantly higher in the tread shoe compared with the smooth shoe (1.00 vs 0.87 and 23.87 N.m vs 16.12 N.m, respectively). The high-traction shoe had significantly higher peak ankle external rotation moments (89.58 N.m vs 80.17 N.m), peak knee external rotation moments (36.23 N.m vs 32.02 N.m), peak knee adduction moments (224.0 N.m vs 186.8 N.m), and knee adduction angular impulse (2.10 Nms vs 1.83 Nms) compared with the low-traction shoe. CONCLUSION: Increased shoe traction significantly increased ankle and knee joint moments during a V-cut. Despite the significant difference in traction, no difference in performance was observed. These changes could have an effect on ankle and knee joint injury. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Shoes with decreased traction could be used in sports to reduce the joint moments in the knee and ankle and potentially reduce injury without a loss in performance.},

This paper explores the effects of non- linear cushioning material properties and contact geometries on surface shock attenuation performance, using a power-law force-displacement model to describe a broad class of non-linearities. Analysis shows that the maximum displacement of the surface during an impact and the non-linearity of the force-displacement relationship are important determinants of cushioning performance. Typical sports surfaces tend to stiffen when compressed, a material non-linearity that increases the peak acceleration of an impact but reduces impact severity criteria that depend on the average acceleration. Under many conditions and especially when surface thickness is limited, materials that soften or collapse when compressed provide better shock attenuation.},

  abstract = {As increasing amounts of non-plastic silt are added to a sand, its classification transitions from being a sand to being a silty sand to being a sandy silt and eventually to being a silt. This transition leads to a change in the soil’s behavior from sand-like to silt-like with a corresponding increase in compressibility and decrease in both shear strength and resistance to liquefaction. Numerous studies have shown that this change in behavior occurs over a relatively narrow range of silt contents. This range is referred to by several names in the literature, including threshold fines content (TFC). The threshold fines content represents the silt content at which the soil begins to transform from a sand matrix, in which the silt particles are entirely contained in the voids between the sand grains, to a silt matrix that contains isolated sand grains. Below the threshold fines content, the soil behaves essentially as a sand; above the threshold fines content, the soil behaves essentially as a silt.},

Because particle-size data are frequently incomplete, it would be useful to have a method for inferring the complete particle-size distribution from limited data. We present a method for estimating the particle-size distribution from the clay (cl), silt (si), and fine plus very fine sand (fvfs) mass fractions (particle radii, r, between 25 and 125 μm). The method is easy to use, with the estimated distribution being given by a closed-form expression that is defined explicitly in terms of cl, si, and fvfs. The accuracy of the method is evaluated using particle-size data from 125 soils. The results show that the method should not be used when the silt fraction is greater than about 70\%. For other soils, the estimated distribution agrees reasonably well with the true distribution, with the median level of accuracy being characterized by an average absolute deviation of 2\% over 1 μm ≤ r ≤ 1000 μm, and a maximum absolute deviation of 9\%.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for turfgrass growth. Instead of pursuing the maximum yield, most turfgrass managers use nitrogen (N) to maintain a sub-maximal growth rate. Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the currently existing turf growth prediction model only takes temperature into account, limiting its accuracy. This study developed machine-learning-based turf growth models using the random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate short-term turfgrass clipping yield. To build the RF model, a large set of variables were extracted as predictors including the 7-day weather, traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, and the normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index. In this study, the data were collected from two putting greens where the turfgrass received 0 to 1,800 round/week traffic rates, various irrigation rates to maintain the soil moisture content between 9 and 29\%, and N fertilization rates of 0 to 17.5 kg ha−1 applied biweekly. The RF model agreed with the actual clipping yield collected from the experimental results. The temperature and relative humidity were the most important weather factors. Including NDRE improved the prediction accuracy of the model. The highest coefficient of determination (R2) of the RF model was 0.64 for the training dataset and was 0.47 for the testing data set upon the evaluation of the model. This represented a large improvement over the existing growth prediction model (R2 = 0.01). However, the machine-learning models created were not able to accurately predict the clipping production at other locations. Individual golf courses can create customized growth prediction models using clipping volume to eliminate the deviation caused by temporal and spatial variability. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating machine-learning-based yield prediction models that may be able to guide N fertilization decisions on golf course putting greens and presumably other turfgrass areas.},

Fifty-nine data for smectite and fifty-one for kaolinite have been plotted and compared to each other. The results show that PI is related to LL with eqs. PI = 0.97 × LL − 37.6 for smectite and PI = 5.94e0.023·LL for kaolinite. An independent data set was used for the validation of the proposed relationships. Besides, it was possible to identify a confidence interval for PI, relative to a certain interval for LL values, to confirm the robustness of the relations given above. The findings of this research show that the relation between the Atterberg limits is clearly controlled by the clay mineralogy and that there is no unique way to get PI from LL if the clay mineralogy is not considered.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) is a metric of surface topography that has been used to evaluate the relationship between the surface complexity of primate cheek teeth and dietary categories. This study examines the effects of different 3D mesh retriangulation protocols on DNE. We examine how different protocols influence the DNE of a simple geometric shape—a hemisphere—to gain a more thorough understanding than can be achieved by investigating a complex biological surface such as a tooth crown. Materials and Methods: We calculate DNE on 3D surface meshes of hemispheres and on primate molars subjected to various retriangulation protocols, including smoothing algorithms, smoothing amounts, target face counts, and criteria for boundary face exclusion. Software used includes R, MorphoTester, Avizo, and MeshLab. DNE was calculated using the R package “molaR.”. Results: In all cases, smoothing as performed in Avizo sharply decreases DNE initially, after which DNE becomes stable. Using a broader boundary exclusion criterion or performing additional smoothing (using “mesh fairing” methods) further decreases DNE. Increasing the mesh face count also results in increased DNE on tooth surfaces. Conclusions: Different retriangulation protocols yield different DNE values for the same surfaces, and should not be combined in meta-analyses. Increasing face count will capture surface microfeatures, but at the expense of computational speed. More aggressive smoothing is more likely to alter the essential geometry of the surface. A protocol is proposed that limits potential artifacts created during surface production while preserving pertinent features on the occlusal surface.},

The shrinkage limit of a natural soil has been shown to be primarily a result of the packing phenomenon, which in turn is governed by the grain-size distribution of the soil; the shrinkage limit of pure clays appears to be affected by the fabric also. Even though clay-sized particles play an important role in the shrinkage phenomenon, there is an optimum clay content at which the shrinkage limit of a soil can become minimum. It has been further illustrated that the shrinkage limit is not at all related to the plasticity characteristics of the soil. As the factors governing the shrinkage limit are entirely different from those controlling the swelling of soils, the shrinkage limit cannot indicate the swelling behavior of the soil.},

The mechanism controlling the undrained shear strength behaviour of soils is a function of clay mineralogy of the soils. The present investigation proposes two mechanisms to explain the contradictory behaviour of kaolinitic and montmorillonitic soils under undrained conditions. The undrained shear strength of kaolinitic soils is a result of the net attractive forces and the mode of particle arrangement as governed by the interparticle forces, whereas that of montmorillonitic soils can be attributed to the viscous shear resistance of the double-layer water. The validity of the proposed mechanisms is confirmed by the results of the present investigation and those in the literature.},

The purpose of compacting earth fills such as earth dams and embankments (highway, railway and canal) is to produce a soil mass that will satisfy the two basic criteria: reduction in settlement and increase in shear strength. For preliminary design and assessment, correlations with the liquid limit have been attempted by various investigators. However, from the present study it is seen that the correlations are not up to a satisfactory level. In this paper the results of detailed investigations carried out are examined to find which of the index properties correlate well with the compaction characteristics. In the analysis, apart from the authors' experimental results, results from the available literature have also been considered. It is found that the plastic limit bears a good correlation with the compaction characteristics, namely optimum moisture content and maximum dry unit weight, much better than liquid limit or plasticity index. © 2005 Thomas Telford Ltd.},

Research involving athlete–surface interactions often fails to thoroughly account for variability by grouping these fields into the single category of “natural turfgrass.” This can obscure results and make it difficult to identify specific field characteristics that most strongly influence athletes, making it almost impossible to implement strategies for improvement. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight the between- and within-field variations of turfgrass sports fields and their influence on athlete–surface interactions. The components of turfgrass sports fields and common methods used to objectively quantify surface characteristics in situ are discussed. Then, current literature is reviewed that involves several athlete–surface interactions under a variety of turfgrass sports field scenarios. It was found that turfgrass surface characteristics generally influence athlete biomechanics, performance and physiology, perceptions, and injury occurrence. To better interpret and compare findings, it is recommended that future studies fully describe field characteristics and management practices. Consistency with field and athlete data collection methods, analysis, and reporting are also important. Athlete–surface interaction research incorporating new technologies; addressing athlete performance, physiology, and psychological aspects; and investigating athletes other than professionals is also needed. These recommendations are more likely to happen with increased collaboration between turfgrass scientists, sports turf managers, sports scientists, and sports medicine clinicians. Ultimately, the goal would be to develop evidence-based guidelines for turfgrass sports field management that improve the overall athlete experience under an assortment of turfgrass sports field scenarios.},

Focus lies on the characterisation of particle angularity using 3D scanner data. In the literature, angularity is often characterised using 2D data, as these types of data are easier to collect. 3D scanner data contain a vast amount of information (e.g. curvatures) which can be used for shape analysis and angularity characterisation. Literature approaches that use 3D data are often not thoroughly tested, due to a lack of test cases. In this work, two new curvature-based angularity indices are introduced and compared to one from the literature. Analytical test bodies with shapes ranging from spherical towards cubic are used for a first plausibility test. Then, 3D scans of ballast stones are compared to artificially rounded meshes. Only one out of three evaluated angularity indices seem to be suited to characterise angularity correctly in all of the above tests: the newly introduced scaled Willmore energy. A complete shape analysis of the scanned ballast stones is conducted and no difference between the two types of ballast can be seen regarding form, angularity, roughness, sphericity or convexity index. These findings of shape analysis are set in the context of previous works, where experimental results and DEM simulations of uniaxial compression tests and direct shear tests were presented for the same ballast types.},

Because plants do not directly respond to the activity of H+, it is pertinent to enquire why this approach to liming has enjoyed such widespread popularity. Among the reasons, the original near-neutral pH of many of the soils was no doubt a consideration and the use of acid-sensitive legumes to supply N in rotations in the early stages of agricultural development also played a part. The introduction of the pH meter at about the same time as N fertilizers found widespread popularity replacing legumes in rotations facilitated the measurement of soil acidity and removed the focus from the real problems of soil acidity, namely, toxic levels of Al3+ and Mn2+ and deficiencies of nutrients such as Ca, Mg, N, S, P and Mo. Even after legumes disappeared from the rotations, the high target pH values were retained. Liming experiments throughout the world reveal that, wi...},

This method has been applied by many researchers to study soil compaction, acting forces on tools, stress distribution in soils and soil failure patterns. The great majority of studies that have investigated soil failure patterns have been limited to in-laboratory soil bins, with few tests being done under field conditions. However, it is difficult to simulate actual soil conditions in a soil bin. This study used FEM for the simulation of the soil failure patterns as linked to consistency limits and sticky point of soil, comparing the simulation results with soil failure patterns observed in the soil bin and in the field. Results showed that FEM is a useful tool to simulate soil failure patterns; however, simulation models correlated better with soil bin than with field test results. The results also showed the presence of a direct relationship between soil failure patterns and the consistency limits of the soil, both in the soil bin and in the field. However, soil bin results were not satisfactorily verified in the field, in particular as the failure patterns were also found to be affected by the roots of the stubbles in the field. It is concluded that FEM can provide accurate simulation of soil failure patterns under soil bin test conditions, but that soil bin results did not satisfactorily represent results from the field.},

Recently, LDA has come into use in environmental sciences. However, in the size range of silt and clay deviations from the particle-size analysis with the standard pipette method, which is regarded as the reference method for soil-texture classification, have been reported. Therefore, this study concentrates (1) on the verification of systematic relations between both methods using a series of soils of Lower Saxony (Germany) and (2) on the general applicability of the laser-diffraction method to soil-texture classification as well as (3) texture-based estimates of air capacity, available field capacity, and permanent wilting point. The comparison of LDA with the pipette method demonstrated highly significant linear correlations in each of the particle-size fractions from clay to coarse silt. The slope of regressions ranged from 0.4 with fine silt to 3.1 with clay. If the clay content derived from LDA was applied to texture classification, the resulting textural classes differed from the standard textural classes, except for purely sandy samples with a clay content of {$<$}5\%. However, the linear-regression model enabled an approach of the LDA-based clay content to values produced with the standard pipette method. Using this transformation, a texture classification became practicable in many cases, but, despite of a high significance level between LDA and pipette method, still led to wrong textural classes in several cases. A comparison with regression models from other regions in Europe showed both similarities and discrepancies, even for similar substrates. Hence, the laser-diffraction analysis cannot be used for the texture classification of soil samples without verification by the standard pipette method. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA.},

Hypotheses examined are that sludge loading rates far above recommendations based on crop nutrient removal (i) are possible without reducing turf growth and quality, (ii) do not cause an accumulation of N and P below the active root zone, (iii) can minimize soil loss through sod harvesting, and (iv) do not cause unacceptably high nitrate and salt leaching. An 8 Mg ha(-1) sludge control (the recommended limit) was compared with sludge rates of 0, 33, 67, and 100 Mg ha(-1) on a loamy, kaolinitic, mesic, Typic Eutrustox soil near Johannesburg, South Africa. Sludge application rates up to 67 Mg ha(-1) significantly improved turfgrass establishment rate and color. The ability of sods to remain intact during handling and transport improved as the sludge application rate increased to 33 Mg ha(-1) but deteriorated at higher rates. A sludge application rate of 100 Mg ha(-1) was needed to eliminate soil loss, but this rate was associated with unacceptably high N leaching losses. All our hypotheses were accepted for application rates not exceeding 33 Mg ha(-1) on the proviso that some soil loss was acceptable and that the leaching fraction was carefully managed during the first 2 mo after sludge application.},

Purpose: To establish normative biomechanical parameters during the countermovement jump (CMJ) among Major League Baseball (MLB) players and evaluate the relationship between CMJ-developed algorithms and advanced statistical metrics. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: MLB players in 2 professional organizations performed the CMJ at the beginning of each baseball season from 2013 to 2017. We collected ground-reaction force data including the eccentric rate of force development (“load”), concentric vertical force (“explode”), and concentric vertical impulse (“drive”) as well as the Sparta Score. The advanced statistical metrics from each baseball season (eg, fielding independent pitching [FIP], weighted stolen base runs [wSB], and weighted on-base average) were also gathered for the study participants. The minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated for each CMJ variable to establish normative parameters. Pearson coefficient analysis and regression trees were used to evaluate associations between CMJ data and advanced statistical metrics for the players. Results: A total of 151 pitchers and 138 batters were included in the final analysis. The MDC for “load,” “explode,” “drive,” and the Sparta Score was 10.3, 8.1, 8.7, and 4.6, respectively, and all demonstrated good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient {$>$} 0.75). There was a weak but statistically significant correlation between the Sparta Score and wSB (r ¼ 0.23; P ¼ .007); however, there were no significant correlations with any other advanced metrics. Regression trees demonstrated superior FIP with higher Sparta Scores in older pitchers compared with younger pitchers.

  abstract = {A silty sand is considered as a delicate composite matrix containing a sand-grain-matrix and a silt-matrix. Large strain undrained shear strength (S..) data in triaxial compression for a particular host sand mixed with different amounts of nonplastic fines are presented. Results indicate that the intergranular void ratio, e" which is the void ratio of the sand-grain-matrix [given by (e + fe)/(l - fe), where fe is the silt content fraction by weight], plays an important role on S.. of silty sands. At the same void ratio, e, a silty sand shows low S.. compared to that of the host sand. However, when compared at the same e" provided that it is less than the maximum void ratio of the host sand, emax.HS, both the silty sand and the host sand show similar S.. that is fairly independent of the initial confining stress. When e. of the silty sand is in the vicinity of or exceeds emuJls, the Sws depends on the initial effective confining stress. At such "loose" states, Sws normalized with respect to the initial consolidation stress, (S..ler',.,), is very low and it decreases with a further increase in e•. At a fines content greater than about 30\%, a silty sand or sandy silt is expected to behave as a silt at an interfine void ratio, el' defined as the void ratio of the silt-matrix (given by e/je), unless the silty sand or sandy silt is very dense. A criterion is presented for the undrained shear strength behavior of silty sands in terms of relative percent compaction for field applications. Preliminary recommendations are presented for the choice of undrained strength for seismic stability evaluation against large deformations.},

Analyses of 220 samples of the Porters Creek collected in Illinois, Missouri, and Tennessee indicate that the smectite content is highest on the western side of the Mississippi embayment and that the kaolinite content is highest on the northeastern side. The major influx of detritral clays appears to have entered the embayment from a large river on the northeast side. A major control of the distribution of clay minerals during the time of Porters Creek deposition was differential flocculation of kaolinite, illite, and smectite, as evidenced by the numerous syneresis cracks on bedding planes in the area of greatest kaolinite content. Estimates of the smectite, illite, and kaolinite contents suggest both horizontal and vertical variations among these clay minerals. In certain localities the oxidation of pyrite has created acid conditions, which apparently were conducive to the formation of authigenic halloysite.},

Test strips were compacted using a prototype CP-533 static padfoot roller with integrated MDP technology and tested using various in situ compaction measurement devices. To characterize the roller machine-soil interaction, soil testing focused on measuring compaction parameters for the compaction layer. Variation in both MDP and in situ measurements was observed and attributed to inherent variability of the compaction layer and measurement errors. Considering the controlled operations to create relatively uniform conditions of the test strips, measurement vari-ability observed in this study establishes a baseline for acceptable variation in production operations using MDP technology in cohesive soils. Predictions of in situ compaction measurements from MDP were found to be highly correlated when moisture content and MDP-moisture interaction terms were incorporated into regression models.},

Although both devices use weighted missiles equipped with accelerometers to measure impact attenuation, G max , little information is available in the peer-reviewed scientific literature comparing data collected with these devices on natural and synthetic turf athletic field playing surfaces. A 2-year field study was conducted at the University of Tennessee Center for Athletic Field Safety in 2012 and 2013 to determine whether data collected with a CIST could be used to predict values with the F355. Ten different synthetic turf and four natural turfgrass surfaces constructed over four root zone types were subjected to 30 simulated traffic events at two rates (three events wk À1 and 10 events wk À1). Three impact attenuation samples were collected with both devices on all surfaces for each rate of simulated traffic. Two regression analyses were conducted: one using all 252 data points collected annually and a second that incorporated blocking to account for within surface sampling. In both years, associations between impact attenuation data collected with the CIST and the F355 were weak. CIST values only explained 9 \% of the variability in F355 data in 2012 (R 2 ¼ 0.09) and 24 \% in 2013 (R 2 ¼ 0.24). When accounting for surface sampling, CIST values only explained 46 \% of the variability in F355 data in 2012 (R 2 ¼ 0.46) and 56 \% in 2013 (R 2 ¼ 0.56). Residuals around these best-fit regression lines were 625 G max , indicating that the CIST cannot accurately predict impact attenuation values with the F355 within this range. Future research should continue to explore relationships between the F355 and CIST across diverse playing surface types and environments.},

  abstract = {Grass shoots after defoliation can be supplied with the nitrogen required for regrowth by either root uptake or remobilization of stores. Whilst it is accepted that after a single defoliation inhibition of root uptake and remobilization from root occurs, it has not been established how the capability of roots to supply nitrogen by uptake and from storage is affected with differing severities of regular defoliation, as experienced by grazed swards. The objective was to examine this question using Agrostis castellana Boiss et Reut., Festuca rubra L., Lolium perenne L. and Poa trivialis L., grasses associated with sites of differing fertility, grown in sand culture and defoliated weekly at a height of either 4 or 8 cm. Nitrogen was supplied as NH4NO3 in a complete nutrient solution. The use of 15N as a tracer allowed the nitrogen supplied to the shoot by root uptake and remobilization to be discriminated over a 35 day period. An increased severity of defoliation resulted in decreased root mass, and increased nitrogen uptake per unit root weight for all species. Increased severity of defoliation did not affect uptake on a per plant basis for A. castellana, 0.54 mg N (plant)-1 (week)-1 and P. rubra, 0.40 mg N (plant)-1 (week)-1, whilst mg N (plant)-1(week)-1 decreased from 0.54 to 0.14, and 0.54 to 0.34 for L perenne and P. trivialis respectively. For plants clipped at 4 or 8 cm, over 88\% and 77\% respectively of uptake appeared in the shoot. Nitrogen was remobilized from roots to the shoot for A. castellana and F. rubra when clipped at 4 cm, and for A. castellana, L. perenne and P. trivialis when clipped at 8 cm. Uptake by roots was more important than remobilization from roots in supplying nitrogen to the shoot. The ability to maintain the supply of nitrogen by uptake and remobilization to the shoot with increased severity of defoliation was species dependent.},

Preparative procedures were investigated using four undisturbed soils (albic, calcic, humic, and argillic horizons) chosen to exhibit contrasting properties. Roots of sown Lolium perenne, their associated AM-mycorrhizas, and indigenous fungi and actinomycetes of the soils were used as indicators of the quality of preservation of biological material in sections of 15 μm thickness. Crystic 17449 and Palatal P50-01 proved most suitable, producing durable sections in 2-3 weeks with excellent preservation of roots, microbes and inorganic features in all the soils tested.},

  abstract = {1. Bunchgrasses are clonal plants whose dominance of moist grasslands worldwide is maintained largely through tiller recruitment. Tiller recruitment in clonal plants is a subset of the problem of lateral bud outgrowth in higher plants. This paper proposes that three currently competing hypotheses of lateral bud outgrowth – apical dominance; the nutrition hypothesis; and photosensitivity to the red : far-red light ratio – all operate in a manner dependent on environment and plant form. 2. The evidence for each hypothesis is reviewed, following which an integrated model is provided that links the three hypotheses into a cohesive strategy. Consequently we assess tiller recruitment by bunchgrasses in terms of the constraints of their functional growth form and their environment. Of the mineral nutrients, only nitrogen is con- sidered because it is the only nutrient whose relationship with tiller recruitment is well established. 3. The integrated model maintains the accepted paradigm that actual bud release is hormonally controlled by the auxin : cytokinin ratio, although local nutrient concen- trations may also be inhibitory. Importantly, each hormone is controlled by local signals in the shoots and roots, respectively, facilitating appropriate responses to environmental conditions. Auxin production and export from the shoots is moderated by phytochrome responses to red : far-red light ratios. Cytokinin production is mediated by root N concentration which, in turn, is a function of N absorption from the soil and seasonal reallocation of tissue N. 4. The growth form of bunchgrasses and the environment in which they are found emphasize that N has a strong mediatory role over tiller production which allows the grass plant to respond appropriately to shifts in this limiting resource. This suggests that control of lateral bud outgrowth may have an evolutionary basis in resource competition for N.},

However, the number of Clegg hammer drops reported in natural grass testing varies from one to four drops, and the impact of the choice of the number of drops is unknown. The aim of this article is to determine whether significant differences exist between the four Clegg hammer drops on natural grass across a variety of conditions. Hardness read-ings (using a 2.25 kg Clegg hammer), soil moisture and botanical composition were recorded at nine different sites on seven football fields during an 18-week playing season. A total of 1255 hardness readings were collected for each of four consecutive Clegg hammer drops. Overall, there were significant differences between drop 1 and the other three con-secutive drops, on all fields and on all sites. Deep soil moisture was the only factor that significantly influenced the hard-ness readings. The results of this study demonstrate that the decision regarding the number of drops recorded needs careful consideration as conclusions drawn on playability of a ground or the association with injury risk may vary consid-erably depending on the number of drops.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies on unsaturated soils are generally costly, time-consuming, and difficult to conduct. Shear strength data from the research literature suggests that there is a nonlinear increase in strength as the soil desaturates as a result of an increase in matric suction. Since the shear strength of an unsaturated soil is strongly related to the amount of water in the voids of the soil, and therefore to matric suction, it is postulated that the shear strength of an unsaturated soil should also bear a relationship to the soil-water characteristic curve. This paper describes the relationship between the soil-water characteristic curve and the shear strength of an unsaturated soil with respect to matric suction. Am empirical, analytical model is developed to predict the shear strength in terms of soil suction. The formulation makes use of the soil-water characteristic curve and the saturated shear strength parameters. The results of the model developed for predicting the shear strength are compared with experimental results for a glacial till. The shear strength of statically compacted glacial till specimens was measured using a modified direct shear apparatus. Specimens were prepared at three different water contents and densities (i.e., corresponding to dry of optimum, and wet of optimum conditions). Various net normal stresses and matric suctions were applied to the specimens. There is a good correlation between the predicted and measured values of shear strength for the unsaturated soil.},

  abstract = {The Atterberg Limits are the most common tests specified by practicing geotechnical and pavement engineers the world over. They are used to classify soils using the framework pioneered by Terzaghi and Casagrande during their work with the U.S. Public Roads Bureau in the 1920s and 1930s and are also correlated with many fundamental soil parameters used in design and construction projects. In the 21st century the Atterberg Limits remain a key component of the testing armory of practicing geotechnical engineers, as they can be obtained easily for the large numbers of samples that are needed on major construction projects and allow for rapid assessments of key soil parameters. Their fundamental definitions are worthy of review; the thread-rolling test for plastic limit has remained largely unchanged since Atterberg first described it in 1911, but the definition and measurement of liquid limit varies across the globe. The fundamental mechanics of the Casagrande Cup liquid limit have been the subject of recent study showing clearly that liquid limit determined in this way relates to a fixed value of specific soil strength (i.e. strength per unit density) as opposed to a fixed strength value when liquid limit is measured by the fall-cone method. These findings explain the deviation between liquid limits measured by the two methods for high plasticity soils without the need to invoke different strength regimes. The brittle failure mechanism in the thread-rolling test has also been recently re-examined. It is proposed that the brittle failure observed in the plastic limit test is caused by either air entry or cavitation in the clay and plastic limit and does not correspond to a fixed strength. The Atterberg Limits are used to compute liquidity index which is widely related to clay strength variation; this is critical for many areas of construction (especially when rapid assessments of strength are required). The Russian code for the design of piled foundations, for example, uses liquidity index values to assess shaft friction. Recent research outcomes at the University of Cambridge have challenged certain assumptions pertaining to widely used correlations between liquidity index and undrained strength.},

This is confirmed by the development of National Income estimates and of the National Accounts. Proposals to integrate environmental costs and benefits into the National Accounts can similarly only be evaluated by considering them in the context of their likely policy use. The most important potential use is as a general measure of welfare or progress, for policy to aim to maximise. Environmentally adjusted National Accounts correspond to a very weak view of sustainability. The use of adjusted National Income as a measure of welfare essentially assumes complete substitutability between manufactured and natural capital. Problems of monetary valuation are likely to lead to huge underestimation of environmental costs. Issues of inequality and poverty, essential to a more robust view of sustainability, are ignored. Policy targeting a revised National Income will continue to aim for ever higher output while making very limited concessions to environmental concerns. Adjusting the National Accounts for environmental costs is not the only way to ensure they are allowed for in policy making. An alternative approach, more appropriate if sustainable development in the stronger sense is to be achieved, is the construction and use of a set of social and environmental indicators.},

The laboratory Proctor compaction test consumes more effort, time and huge quantity of soil. Moreover, if the index properties of borrow materials changes for small stretches of highway then preserving such vast quantity of soil in the laboratory and conducting Proctor compaction test becomes lengthy, laborious and expensive. Therefore, attempts were made formerly to predict compaction parameters through the index properties intending to reduce the time involved. This paper explores the existing models in the literature which seek out to improve the database. Based on the review, it is perceived that a simple model with an extended range of index properties, known either from bibliographies or project reports or database of the quarry, of fine-grained and coarse-grained soil could be developed.},

Through a review and analysis of reported literature on compaction characteristics of fine grained soils, it is shown that toughness limit-the water content at which soil state changes from a virtually non workable adhesive-plastic region to a workable tough-plastic region-bears a good correlation with optimum moisture content. The accuracy of optimum moisture content prediction is seen to improve when different correlation equations are used for low-to-medium plastic and highly plastic soils. At all energy levels studied, maximum dry unit weight is found to bear a good correlation with the dry unit weight at toughness limit water content. The range of workable or tough-plastic region has been identified as nearly 0.42 times the conventional plastic region as proposed by Atterberg. Thus the study also emphasises the combined influence of liquid limit and plastic limit on compaction parameters of fine grained soils at any rational compactive effort.},

  abstract = {Soil colour is an important soil property. It is frequently used by soil scientists for the identification and classification of soil. It is also used as an indicator of field soil physical, chemical and biological properties as well as of the occurrence of soil processes. Measurements of soil colour are commonly made using the Munsell soil colour charts. A number of other colour space models, that overcome some of the limitations of the Munsell HVC system exist and may be used to more aptly describe soil colour. We looked at nine colour space models and a redness index: Munsell HVC, RGB, decorrelated RGB (DRGB), CIE XYZ, CIE Yxy, CIELAB, CIELUV, CIELHC, and Helmoltz chromaticity coordinates. The aims of this paper are to (i) describe the algorithms used for transformations between these colour space models, (ii) compare their representational qualities and their relationships to the Munsell soil colour system, and (iii) in a case study, determine the model best suited to describe the relationship between soil colour and soil organic carbon. The type of colour model to use will depend on the purpose. For example, if soil colour is being used for merely descriptive purposes, then the Munsell HVC system will remain appropriate; if it is being used for numerical statistical or predictive analysis, as in our case study, then colour models that use Cartesian-type coordinate systems will be more useful. Of these, the CIELUV and CIELCH models appear to be more suitable for predictions of soil organic carbon. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ready-to-use charts are included, showing the effect of PI on the location of the modulus reduction curve G/G\^ versus cyclic shear strain y c , and on the material damping ratio X versus y c curve. The charts are based on experimental data from 16 publications encompassing normally and overconsolidated clays (OCR = 1-15), as well as sands. It is shown that PI is the main factor controlling G/G ma and X for a wide variety of soils; if for a given y c PI increases, G/G ma rises and X is reduced. Similar evidence is presented showing the influence of PI on the rate of modulus degradation with the number of cycles in normally consolidated clays. It is concluded that soils with higher plasticity tend to have a more linear cyclic stress-strain response at small strains and to degrade less at larger y c than soils with a lower PI. Possible reasons for this behavior are discussed. A parametric study is presented showing the influence of the plasticity index on the seismic response of clay sites excited by the accelerations recorded on rock in Mexico City during the 1985 earthquake.},

It appears that linear interpolation, the traditional method (DOS), and the Josek and Gradistat Programs give comparable results, but that quadratic interpolation and the method of moments should not be applied since they yield unreliable results. The method of moments gives unduly high or unduly low parameter values because of the application of different, i.e. incomparable measures in the applied formulae. It should be stressed that only extrapolation provides, if performed under the right conditions, the possibility to determine some parameters, in particular skewness values.},

  abstract = {Summer bentgrass decline is associated with inhibition of plant growth and cytokinin production. This study was designed to investigate whether shoot and root growth and cytokinin production for creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) exposed to heat stress would be improved by extending photoperiod. 'Penncross' plants were initially grown in growth chambers at 20/15degreesC (day/night) and at a 14-h photoperiod for 60 d, and then exposed to 33/28degreesC (heat stress) with three different photoperiods: 14 (control), 18, and 22 h (extended photoperiod) daily for 32 d. Root number, fresh weight, viability, turf quality, and shoot extension rate declined during heat stress at the 14-h photoperiod. The decline was delayed and suppressed by extending photoperiod from 14 to 18 or 22 h. Root growth, turf quality, and shoot extension rate increased with extending photoperiod. Cytokinin content in roots and leaves also decreased during heat stress at the 14-h photoperiod. Plants at the 22- and 18-h photoperiods maintained higher cytokinin content in roots at 16 and 32 d of heat stress. The differences in total cytokinin content in leaves among photoperiod treatments were mainly due to the variations in trans-zeatin [6-(4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enylamino) purine], zeatin riboside [6-[(E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enylamino]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-purine ] and isopentenyl adenosine [iPA, 6-(3,3-dimethylailylamino)9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine]. Cytokinin content in leaves at the 14-and 18-h photoperiods decreased at 16 d of stress, but at the 22-h photoperiod it did not decrease until 32 d. These results demonstrated that extended photoperiod increased root and shoot growth and endogenous cytokinin levels under heat stress, suggesting that extended photoperiod could alleviate heat injury in creeping bentgrass.},

In order to investigate the influence of mixtures of red clay and gravel on the road performance, gravitational compaction experiment of red clay and vibratory compaction experiment of mixtures of red clay and gravel were conducted, respectively. The results indicate that compaction curves of red clay have double peak; the second peak is the real maximum dry density, and its corresponding moisture content is the optimal moisture content. The dry density of mixtures of red clay and gravel is influenced by the content of gravel, vibration frequency, and vibration time. The optimal content of gravel is 30\%, the best vibration frequency is 45 Hz, and the optimal vibration time is 5 minutes for the mixtures of red clay and gravel in this study. The effectiveness of optimal content of gravel and optimum vibration parameters was confirmed by a CBR test. According to the compaction experiment results and actual situation in the field, a suitable construction method of subgrade using the mixtures of red clay and gravel was put forward. The feasibility of this method was also confirmed by postconstruction deformation data of the field test embankment.},

On the basis of the different dehydroxylation temperatures, a thermal analysis is an effective method used to identify the cv and tv configurations of an octahedral sheet in dioctahedral smectites. The proportions of cv and tv configurations were determined by fitting the derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves. A wide range of cv and tv proportions were detected in the samples. The dehydroxylation temperatures of samples consisting of cv configuration are about 150 to 200 ◦C higher than those consisting of tv configurations. The samples were classified as tv varieties when octahedral Fe3+ {$>$} 0.46 mol/FU, and the pure tv dioctahedral smectites were found when Fe3+ {$>$} 1.8 mol/FU. A clear linear relationship was found between the content of octahedral Fe3+ and Al3+ and the proportion of cv and tv configurations. The substitution of Al3+ by Fe3+ in the octahedral sheets is the main factor for the formation of tv varieties. There was no relationship detected between the layer charge density, octahedral Mg2+ content, and the proportion of tv and cv. The present results indicate that the iron content has a significant effect on the structure of the octahedral sheet.},

This increase is attributed to a surge in hydrofracking, a technique used by the petroleum industry to extract natural gas and/or crude oil from rock formations, which requires a certain quality of sand in the process. Wisconsin possesses high-quality sand resources and therefore is seeing a substantial rise in mining permit requests to mine for frac sand. Consequently, the topic of sand mining in Wisconsin has generated interest from regulators, legislators, local government, and the general public. 2.0 Purpose of this document This is an informational document that summarizes our best current information on the mining process, possible environmental impacts, and applicable regulations. There are no oil or gas wells located in Wisconsin, thus this document does not address the effects of the hydrofracking technique.

  abstract = {Compaction vulnerability of different types of soils by hikers and vehicles is poorly known, particularly for soils of arid and semiarid regions. Engineering analyses have long shown that poorly sorted soils (for example, sandy loams) compact to high densities, whereas well-sorted soils (for example, eolian sand) do not compact, and high gravel content may reduce compaction. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (ORPI) in southwestern Arizona, is affected greatly by illicit activities associated with the United States–Mexico border, and has many soils that resource managers consider to be highly vulnerable to compaction. Using geospatial soils data for ORPI, compaction vulnerability was estimated qualitatively based on the amount of gravel and the degree of sorting of sand and finer particles. To test this qualitative assessment, soil samples were collected from 48 sites across all soil map units, and undisturbed bulk densities were measured. A scoring system was used to create a vulnerability index for soils on the basis of particle-size sorting, soil properties derived from Proctor compaction analyses, and the field undisturbed bulk densities. The results of the laboratory analyses indicated that the qualitative assessments of soil compaction vulnerability underestimated the area of high vulnerability soils by 73 percent. The results showed that compaction vulnerability of desert soils, such as those at ORPI, can be quantified using laboratory tests and evaluated using geographic information system analyses, providing a management tool that managers potentially could use to inform decisions about activities that reduce this type of soil disruption in protected areas.},

  abstract = {Soil compaction quality control plays an important role in earthwork construction. Compacted dry density is only loosely related to the actual deformation of the compacted soil. Rather than using dry density as the controlling factor for compacted fills, it would be better to measure properties more closely related to soil compressibility. The Briaud compaction device (BCD) is a simple, small-strain, nondestructive testing apparatus that can be used to evaluate the modulus of compacted soils. The use of the BCD as a field testing device for compacted soil quality control may be more beneficial than the current practice of measuring in situ dry density. In this study, the laboratory procedures of the BCD were evaluated for compacted silt. The modulus determined by the BCD was compared to the dynamic elastic moduli (Young's and shear moduli) determined from ultrasonic pulse velocity testing on the same compacted silt samples. The BCD modulus correlated well with the ultrasonic pulse velocity results with R2 value of 0.8 or better. Finally, a repeatability and reproducibility study conducted on the BCD showed a variation of 4\% from the mean when only the soil properties were altered.},

  abstract = {Mathematical descriptions of classical particle size distribution (PSD) data are often used to estimate soil hydraulic properties. Laser diffraction methods (LDM) now provide more detailed PSD measurements, but deriving a function to characterize the entire range of particle sizes is a major challenge. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of eighteen PSD functions for fitting LDM data sets from a wide range of soil textures. These models include five lognormal models, five logistic models, four van Genuchten models, two Fredlund models, a logarithmic model, and an Andersson model. The fits were evaluated using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), adjusted R2, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results indicated that the Fredlund models (FRED3 and FRED4) had the best performance for most of the soils studied, followed by one logistic growth function extension model (MLOG3) and three lognormal models (ONLG3, ORLG3, and SHCA3). The performance of most PSD models was better for soils with higher silt content and poorer for soils with higher clay and sand content. The FRED4 model best described the PSD of clay, silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty loam, loam, and sandy loam, whereas FRED3, MLOG3, ONLG3, ORLG3, and SHCA3 showed better performance for most soils studied.},

  abstract = {The Pennsylvanian strata of western Illinois exhibit a cyclical repetition of beds as follows: (i) sandstone and sandy shales, (2) underclay, (3) coal, and (4) marine limestones and shales. Each cycle was initiated by uplift which was reflected first by erosion and later by continental deposition of clastic materials. This was followed by a long period of stability during which weathering developed a typical poorly drained profile of weathering, now represented by underclay. Then peat, later transformed to coal, accumulated in more or less extensive swamps. These conditions were terminated by subsidence so that the area was inundated by a shallow sea in which marine strata were deposited until uplift brought the cycle to a close. The cyclical repetition of beds is regional rather than local, and analysis of the conditions necessary for the formation and preservation of such strata over broad areas furnishes the basis for a reconstruction of the, physiography of the Pennsylvanian period. The conception of widespread sedimentary cycles provides new criteria for correlation in Pennsylvanian areas, as a definite succession of strata not dependent upon certain key horizons is established. It also furnishes a new basis for paleontologic studies, since faunules restricted to different habitats may be grouped with regard to definite marine invasions and an approximation of the total marine fauna of each invasion may be obtained.},

The test strips were compacted using a prototype CS-533E vibratory smooth drum roller and tested for various compaction parameters using in situ test methods ͑e.g., nuclear moisture density, dynamic cone penetrometer, plate load tests, etc.͒. To characterize the roller machine-ground interaction, soil testing focused on measuring soil com-paction parameters of the compaction layer, to a depth not exceeding 300 mm. The experimental testing of five test strips provided roller data and in situ measurements for several stages of compaction that were used in performing statistical regression analyses. The relationships between data from the roller-integrated compaction technologies were investigated with special consideration for the relative variation that was observed for each measurement system. Statistical averaging mitigated measurement variability and revealed statisti-cally significant ͑R 2 Ͼ 0.9͒ relationships between in situ and roller-integrated compaction measurements. This research demonstrates statistical analysis techniques for which calibration procedures using roller-integrated compaction technologies may be developed.},

Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn’t include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data. The tidyverse has similar goals to R itself, but any comparison to the R Project (R Core Team, 2019) is fundamentally challenging as the tidyverse is written in R, and relies on R for its infrastructure; there is no tidyverse without R! That said, the biggest difference is in priorities: base R is highly focussed on stability, whereas the tidyverse will make breaking changes in the search for better interfaces. Another closely related project is data.table (Dowle \& Srinivasan, 2019), which provides tools roughly to the combination of dplyr, tidyr, tibble, and readr. data.tableThis paper describes the tidyverse package, the components of the tidyverse, and some of the underlying design principles. This is a lot of ground to cover in a brief paper, so we focus on a 50,000-foot view showing how all the pieces fit together with copious links to more detailed resources prioritises},

The extant diversity of lignin-degrading bacteria and fungi is underestimated by culture-dependent methods, limiting our understanding of the functional and ecological traits of decomposers populations. Here, we describe the use of stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with amplicon and shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterize the functional attributes of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungi and bacteria in coniferous forest soils from across North America. We tested the extent to which catabolic genes partitioned among different decomposer taxa; the relative roles of bacteria and fungi, and whether taxa or catabolic genes correlated with variation in lignocellulolytic activity, measured as the total assimilation of 13C-label into DNA and phospholipid fatty acids. We found high overall bacterial degradation of our model lignin substrate, particularly by gram-negative bacteria (Comamonadaceae and Caulobacteraceae), while fungi were more prominent in cellulose-degradation. Very few taxa incorporated 13C-label from more than one lignocellulosic polymer, suggesting specialization among decomposers. Collectively, members of Caulobacteraceae could degrade all three lignocellulosic polymers, providing new evidence for their importance in lignocellulose degradation. Variation in lignin-degrading activity was better explained by microbial community properties, such as catabolic gene content and community structure, than cellulose-degrading activity. SIP significantly improved shotgun metagenome assembly resulting in the recovery of several high-quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes and over 7500 contigs containing unique clusters of carbohydrate-active genes. These results improve understanding of which organisms, conditions and corresponding functional genes contribute to lignocellulose decomposition.}

  abstract = {In many materials, both ductile and brittle, cracks propagate by the nucleation and growth of cavities in advance of the crack tip. During stable crack growth, a steady-state can be achieved in which the size of cavities depends only on their position ahead of the crack tip. In the present paper we have modelled this process in a general way. We assume that the stress field ahead of the crack tip can be determined independently of the cavitation process. We then use general parametric equations for the variation of local stress with position ahead of a crack tip [σ = (A/x)x], and for the growth velocity of cavities as a function of local stress (v = φσβ), to determine the average rate of crack extension. It is shown that these equations are of the right form to be used with established models of plastic relaxation ahead of a crack tip and of cavity growth. We find that the nucleation process influences the rate of crack growth only if the parameter, αβ, is less than 1. Two approaches to cavity nucleation are considered, and their affect on crack growth assessed. Finally, several examples of the use of the model are presented for both ductile and brittle materials, in which cavities grow by a variety of mechanisms involving both diffusion and plasticity. A large range of crack growth behaviour is predicted, and we find that many of the published models for creep crack growth, fit into our solution as special cases. © 1982.},

Amounts of weathering debris that compose continental and oceanic sedimentary rocks provide one such source of information and indicate that mean denudation over the past half-billion years of Earth history has lowered continental surfaces by a few tens of meters per million years. In comparison, construction and agricultural activities currently result in the transport of enough sediment and rock to lower all ice-free continental surfaces by a few hundred meters per million years. Humans are now an order of magnitude more important at moving sediment than the sum of all other natural processes operating on the surface of the planet. Relationships between temporal trends in land use and global population indicate that humans became the prime agents of erosion sometime during the latter part of the first millennium A.D.},

  abstract = {Rock uplift and erosional denudation of orogenic belts have long been the most important geologic processes that serve to shape continental surfaces, but the rate of geomorphic change resulting from these natural phenomena has now been outstripped by human activities associated with agriculture, construction, and mining. Although humans are now the most important geomorphic agent on the planet's surface, natural and anthropogenic processes serve to modify quite different parts of Earth's landscape. In order to better understand the impact of humans on continental erosion, we have examined both long-term and short-term data on rates of sediment transfer in response to glacio-fluvial and anthropogenic processes.Phanerozoic rates of subaerial denudation inferred from preserved volumes of sedimentary rock require a mean continental erosion rate on the order of 16 m per million years (m/m.y.), resulting in the accumulation of ∼5 gigatons of sediment per year (Gt/yr). Erosion irregularly increased over the ∼542 m.y. span of Phanerozoic time to a Pliocene value of 53 m/m.y. (16 Gt/yr). Current estimates of large river sediment loads are similar to this late Neogene value, and require net denudation of ice-free land surfaces at a rate of ∼62 m/m.y. (∼21 Gt/yr). Consideration of the variation in large river sediment loads and the geomorphology of respective river basin catchments suggests that natural erosion is primarily confined to drainage headwaters; ∼83\% of the global river sediment flux is derived from the highest 10\% of Earth's surface.Subaerial erosion as a result of human activity, primarily through agricultural practices, has resulted in a sharp increase in net rates of continental denudation; although less well constrained than estimates based on surviving rock volumes or current river loads, available data suggest that present farmland denudation is proceeding at a rate of ∼600 m/m.y. (∼75 Gt/yr), and is largely confined to the lower elevations of Earth's land surface, primarily along passive continental margins; ∼83\% of cropland erosion occurs over the lower 65\% of Earth's surface.The conspicuous disparity between natural sediment fluxes suggested by data on rock volumes and river loads (∼21 Gt/yr) and anthropogenic fluxes inferred from measured and modeled cropland soil losses (75 Gt/yr) is readily resolved by data on thicknesses and ages of alluvial sediment that has been deposited immediately downslope from eroding croplands over the history of human agriculture. Accumulation of postsettlement alluvium on higher-order tributary channels and floodplains (mean rate ∼12,600 m/m.y.) is the most important geomorphic process in terms of the erosion and deposition of sediment that is currently shaping the landscape of Earth. It far exceeds even the impact of Pleistocene continental glaciers or the current impact of alpine erosion by glacial and/or fluvial processes. Conversely, available data suggest that since 1961, global cropland area has increased by ∼11\%, while the global population has approximately doubled. The net effect of both changes is that per capita cropland area has decreased by ∼44\% over this same time interval; ∼1\% per year. This is ∼25 times the rate of soil area loss anticipated from human denudation of cropland surfaces. In a context of per capita food production, soil loss through cropland erosion is largely insignificant when compared to the impact of population growth.},

To prevent such machines from failing, knowledge about the abrasive wear process is required. This work focuses on the relation between abrasive particle properties and the wear they cause. Sand was taken from several locations around the world, with variations in particle size and shape. The wear of DIN St-52 steel samples caused by the particles was investigated by performing dry sand-rubber wheel tests with the varieties of sand. The sand particles were sieved to determine their size range. The particle shape was characterised by making images with a confocal microscope and calculating shape factors. The experimental results show significant differences in wear caused by the sand varieties tested. Traditionally used characterisation parameters like size and shape factor, however, cannot explain these differences. There appears to be a relation between the amount of wear and a combination of the particle properties tested. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

To simulate subgrade soils at in-service conditions, soil specimens were compacted at various rela-tive compactions and optimum moisture content and then saturated to equilibrium moisture content to test for resilient modulus and soil suc-tion. The filter paper method was used to measure the total and matric suctions of two cohesive soils. Test findings demonstrated that resilient modulus correlated better with the matric suction than with total suc-tion. Matric suction was found to be a key parameter for predicting the resilient modulus of cohesive subgrade soils.

Improved creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) cultivars, sand-based root zones, and skilled superintendents maintain plant health while providing firmer conditions. Many researchers have studied effects of compaction and wear on putting greens, but few have determined the effect of these stresses on ball marks. The objective of this research was to evaluate ball mark severity and recovery of creeping bentgrass under different mowing heights (2.5, 3.2, and 4.0 mm), rolling frequencies (0, 3, or 6 d wk–1), and foot traffic using digital image analysis. Digital images of golf balls placed in the depression were used to calculate ball mark depth, and a cover analysis was conducted to model ball mark injury area using a one phase decay model to determine theoretical maximum injury, slope, and days to 50\% recovery. Soil moisture content was positively correlated with ball mark depth, but common stresses rarely altered ball mark depth. The mean theoretical maximum ball mark injury was 377 mm2 greater for daily rolled treatments in 2010 compared to non-rolled treatments. The slope of recovery rarely changed among treatments suggesting that theoretical maximum ball mark injury area has a greater effect on recovery. Lastly, combining the lowest mowing height or daily rolling and foot traffic slowed the time ball marks took to reach 50\% recovery. This research demonstrates the effects common management practices and soil moisture have on the severity and recovery of ball marks during environmental stress.},

The authors suggest the theoretical substantiation of differences between the notions of primary soil particles (soil building units) and elementary soil particles. Primary soil particles are individual mineral particles. Elementary soil particles are solid-phase products of pedogenesis represented by fragments of rocks and minerals and by organomineral and organic particles, all the components of which participate in chemical and physicochemical interactions. Special attention is paid to the existing classifications of soils according to their textures. It is suggested that the upper boundary of the clay fraction in the Russian classification should be shifted from 1 to 2 µm.},

Their commercial success stems from unrivaled technological properties, whose link to mineralogical composition and particle size is not well understood yet. This work is an in-depth investigation of the mineralogical, chemical, and physical properties with the aim to disclose the reasons of the peculiar technological behavior of these clays. Five clay samples were studied by XRF, XRD (bulk and fractions {$<$}. 2. μm and {$<$}. 0.2. μm), SEM, TEM, rheological characterization, particle size distribution, BET, MBI, Pfefferkorn index, Atterberg plasticity limits, and laboratory simulation of the tilemaking process. The Ukrainian clays are very fine-grained and characterized by poorly ordered kaolinite (Kaol), interstratified illite/smectite (I-Sm) and a low quartz content. The Kaol-to-I-Sm ratio is lower than in conventional ball clays and two different I-Sm types are found to be predominant in the colloidal fraction. Morphologically, clay minerals appear to be mostly subhedral lamellae that curl and fold under pressure. These characteristics explain the outstanding technological properties of Ukrainian clays and particularly their high plasticity and suitable rheological behavior. These properties depend on the peculiar conjunction of mineralogical and grain size factors that are difficult to be reproduced by clay blending or mixing design.},

  abstract = {Digital image analysis is a frequently used research technique to provide an objective measure of turfgrass color, in addition to the traditional visual rating. A commonly used method relies on commercial software package SigmaScan Pro to quantify mean hue angle, saturation, and brightness values from turf images, and to calculate a dark green color index as the measure of color. To enable turf image analysis to function on an open-source platform, a method was developed within ImageJ to batch process turf images for color parameters. This Java-based ImageJ plugin quantifies hue angle, saturation, and brightness values and calculates a dark green color index. In addition, information on the variability of these color parameters can be simultaneously acquired. This new method was used to quantify color parameters of turf images collected from field plots of tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinacea Shreb. Dumort.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), ryegrass (Lolium ssp.), hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy), and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.). While color parameter values differed little between ImageJ and SigmaScan, the time saved in processing images using ImageJ was considerable. Aside from software, analysis of color parameters acquired from the five turfgrass species indicated that hue angle alone can adequately measure turf color in digital images. Results also demonstrated that, in addition to light source, camera settings should remain fixed during photo capture to avoid introducing errors. The ImageJ plug-in developed in this study is made available at www.turffiles.ncsu.edu.},

  abstract = {Within the range of environmental conditions for which creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) is adapted, cultural management significantly influences golf course putting green (PG) growth and quality. The experimental objective was to identify PG quality and growth response to rate, type, and/or timing of foliarly-applied N fertilizer. In 2009 and 2010, three independent fertility trials were conducted on a sand-based PG established to a 1:1 blend of Penn A-1 and Penn A-4 creeping bentgrass. Excepting the zero-N control, treatments were prepared using amine or salt 15-0-7 liquid fertilizer comprising wholly-soluble nutrient forms and applied at 24.5+24.5, 37, or 49 kg N ha(-1). Clipping yields were collected weekly and digested for N content. Canopy reflectance was used to calculate normalized differential vegetative (NDVI) and dark green color (DGCI) indices. Nitrogen rate directly influenced PG mean NDVI, DGCI, clipping yield, and N removal. Likewise, the amine supported greater mean PG quality than the salt fertilizer. Availability of fertilizer, estimated by PG growth and N removal rate, declined dramatically over the 6-wk experiments. Initial PG growth response to the single 49-kg N application significantly exceeded the 24.5+24.5 kg N "split" application. However, beneficial response to split applications, relative to the single 49 kg N treatment, was observed in latter weeks. While commercially-available liquid fertilizers vary in their suitability, managers are recommended to employ a {$<$}15-d reapplication interval in meeting the 15 to 49 kg N ha(-1) monthly creeping bentgrass PG requirement.},
