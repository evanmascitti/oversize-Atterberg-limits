# Core ideas 

1. Sand angularity has little affect on the liquid and plastic limits of sand-clay mixtures

1. For equivalent sand content, the mixtures produced with non-uniform sand had higher liquid limits but similar plastic limits. 

1. Sand-clay mixtures produced using a non-uniform sand required less clay and more water to yield a soil having measurable plasticity, compared to mixes produced using uniform sand with the same mean particle size.
