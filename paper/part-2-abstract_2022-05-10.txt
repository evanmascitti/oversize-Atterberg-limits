Baseball infield soils are commonly manufactured by blending a washed sand with a finer-grained soil. 
The behavior of these soils is markedly affected by their water content so the Atterberg limits may offer a useful means to evaluate these soils. 
Previous research has demonstrated that liquid and plastic limits (LL and PL) of sand-clay mixtures are affected by the quantity and type of the admixed sand. 
Prior work has focused on the particle size of the sand, but these studies have used sand additions exclusively <425 &mu;m due to the oversize removal requirement in ASTM D4318.
Little attention has been given to the angularity and particle-size uniformity of the sand component, particularly for sand exceeding the 425 mu;m boundary.


This research was conducted to evaluate the effect of sand particle angularity and sand-size uniformity on the Atterberg limits of soil mixtures containing a range of sand contents and having a significant mass percentage of sand >425 &mu;m. 


Experiment 1 compared the effect of mixing either an angular or a round sand with kaolinitic clay at sand contents 0-80%. 
Each sand contained particles only 0.5-1.0 mm. 
Little difference was observed in the LL and PL, suggesting sand particle shape plays a minimal role on mix performance.


Experiment 2 compared the effect of sand size uniformity on LL and PL. 
Two sands having similar D~50~ values (`r`` and `r` mm) but varying uniformity (uniformity coefficients of `r experiment_3_Cu_values[["low_Cu"]]` and `r experiment_3_Cu_values[["high_Cu"]]`) were mixed with an illitic clay at sand contents 0-80%.
The high-C~u~ sand had higher LL and PL for equivalent sand content.
The increase in water content was roughly equal (~1 %) for both LL and PL, so little change in plasticity index occured.
Mixtures produced with the high-C~u~ sand maintained their plasticity to higher sand content than those produced with the low-C~u~ sand.
Calculations for the threshold fines content (TFC) and intergranular porosity ($n_{sa}$) indicated mixtures including the high-C~u~ sand could remain plastic up to a greater sand content (~`r max_testable_sand_contents$high_Cu_max_rollable_sand_pct`%) than mixtures including the low-C~u~ sand (~`r max_testable_sand_contents$low_Cu_max_LL_testable_sand_pct`%).
These calculations agreed closely with the experiments, indicating a potential to estimate the threshold fines content from sand properties alone. 


Results from this research compliment other work demonstrating that particles with sieve diameter 2000-425 μm need not be removed for Atterberg limit tests. 
The effect of particle shape was minimal, and while the uniformity effect was measurable, it is still small compared with that of the dominant particle size. 
Uniformity had a more notable influence on the sand content marking a boundary between plastic and nonplastic behavior.

A little shorter version 

The Atterberg limits may offer a useful means to evaluate baseball infield soils because they define changes in soil behavior as a function of water content. 
Previous research has demonstrated that liquid and plastic limits (LL and PL) of sand-clay mixtures are affected by the quantity and type of admixed sand. 
Prior work has focused on sand particle size, but these studies have used sand additions exclusively <425 &mu;m.
Little attention has been devoted to sand angularity and sand-size uniformity, particularly for particles exceeding 425 mu;m.


This research was conducted to clarify the effect of sand angularity and sand-size uniformity on the Atterberg limits of soil mixtures containing a range of sand contents and a significant mass percentage >425 &mu;m.

Results from this research compliment other work demonstrating that sand 2000-425 μm can be included when performing Atterberg limit tests. 
The effect of sand angularity was minimal.
The uniformity effect was measurable, but it was small compared with that of total sand content.
Uniformity had a more notable influence on the sand content marking the boundary between plastic and nonplastic behavior.
